REASONS 
The proposed appeal 
[1] Morning  Star  (St  Lukes  Garden  Apartments) Ltd  ("MS  St  Lukes")  was 
involved in a large development.  The first applicant, Mr Arthur Morgenstern, owned 
99  of  the  100  shares  in  MS  St  Lukes  and  the  second  applicant,  Ms  Tanya  Lavas 
owned  the  other  share.    Stage  one  of  the  development  (241  apartments  and 
associated  retail  units)  was  completed  in  2005.    Stage  two  involved  a  further  53 
apartments, six commercial units and a two-storey commercial building.  As it turned 
out, the required resource consents were not held and work on stage two stopped in   2006.    The  resource  consent  problem  was  not  able  to  be  resolved  until  2010  and 
construction work on stage two did not recommence until late 2010. 
[2] On 30 March 2007, Morning Star Enterprises Ltd ("MSE"), another company 
associated with Mr Morgenstern and of  which he was a director, acquired all of the 
shares  in  MS  St  Lukes.   The  total  consideration  was  $3.5  million.    MSE  sold  these 
shares the following year for $1. 
[3] The respondents are the liquidators of MSE and sued him in respect of, inter 
alia, the acquisition of the MS St Lukes shares.  The claim was brought under ss 131, 
135, 137, 298 and 301 of the Companies Act 1993. 
[4] The evidence as to the 30 March 2007 value of the MS St Lukes shares was 
not satisfactory.  The trial Judge was plainly satisfied that they were not worth $3.5 
million  but  he  was  not  satisfied  as  to  the  amount  of  the  excess.1  He  therefore 
dismissed  a  claim  against  Mr  Morgenstern  under  s  298  of  the  Companies Act.    He 
was, however, satisfied that Mr Morgenstern was in breach of his obligations to MSE 
and  acted  generally  in  breach  of  ss  131,  135  and  137.2  The  loss  suffered  by  MSE 
was,  in  his  assessment,  $3,499,999  (being  the  amount  paid  for  the  shares  less  the 
realisation of $1) and he gave judgment against Mr Morgenstern for that amount.3 
[5] Mr Morgenstern's  subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.4  
The liquidators' cross appeal on the s 298 finding was also dismissed but this was on 
the basis that as the judgment for $3,499,999 had been upheld, "no practical purpose 
would be served in entering judgment against [Mr Morgenstern] again for the same 
amount in the context of the s 298 cross-appeal".5 
[6] The applicants now seek leave to appeal against the judgment of the Court of 
Appeal on what we see as three bases, each of which we will address. 
                                                 1  Jeffreys v Morgenstern [2014] NZHC 308 (Rodney Hansen J) [Morgenstern (HC)] at [96]. 2  See [97]–[116]. 3  At [120] and [129]. 4  Morgenstern  v  Jeffreys [2014] NZCA 449 (O'Regan P, Harrison and White JJ) [Morgenstern 
(CA)]. 5  At [112].   An onus of proof on Mr Morgenstern to prove that the transaction occurred at 
fair value? 
[7] Both the High Court and Court of Appeal were of the view that it was for Mr 
Morgenstern  to  show  that  the  transaction  was  at  fair  value.6  According  to  counsel 
for Mr Morgenstern, they also acted on the basis that a director selling an asset to a 
company must obtain a contemporaneous independent valuation.   
[8] We do not read the judgments of the courts below as proceeding on the basis 
that  there  is  a  duty  to  obtain  a contemporaneous  valuation.    On  the  other  hand,  a 
director  who  does  not  do  so  may  well  find  it  difficult  later  to  establish  that  the 
transaction did occur at fair value and was generally a proper one for the company to 
enter into.  And for reasons explained in Sojourner v Robb, it might be thought to be 
reasonably  obvious  that  there  is  an  onus  on  a  director  (as  a  fiduciary)  in  such 
circumstances to establish fair value.7   
The failure of Mr Morgenstern to call evidence from the accountants on whom 
he claimed to have relied 
[9] Mr  Morgenstern,  in  his  evidence,  claimed  to  have  relied  on  the  advice  of 
certain   accountants.      He   did   not,   however,   call   them   to   give   evidence.  
Unsurprisingly,  his  failure  to  do  so  was  the  subject  of  adverse  comment  from  both 
the High Court and the Court of Appeal.8 
The relief granted 
[10] The  total  amount  owed  to  the  creditors  of  MSE  is  $1,315,807.80,  of  which 
$794,987 is said to be owed to a company owned by Mr Morgenstern.9 
[11] As the Court of Appeal pointed out, the award of $3,499,999 can be justified 
either on a restitutionary basis or as "but for" assessed compensation.10  The  figure 
of  $1,315,807  does  not  allow  for  the  liquidators'  costs.    Any  surplus  in  the 
                                                 6  Morgenstern (HC), above n 1, at [93]; and Morgenstern (CA), above n 4, at [56]–[58] and [65]. 7  Sojourner v Robb [2007] NZCA 493, [2008] 1 NZLR 751 at [21]–[31] and at [76].  8  Morgenstern (HC), above n 1, at [102]; and Morgenstern (CA), above n 4, at [81](c). 9  See Morgenstern (CA), above n 4, at [93](d). 10  At  [98]–[102].    A  purely  restitutionary  claim  would  not  encompass  the  $35,000  paid  to 
Ms Lavas, but in context we do not see this material.   liquidation  will  be  returned  to  Mr  Morgenstern.   There  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that 
the  liquidators  (who  are  subject  to  court  control)  will  act  irrationally  should 
Mr Morgenstern  put  them  in  sufficient  funds  to  discharge  all  debts  and  meet  the 
liquidation costs. 
Conclusion 
[12] The  proposed  appeal  does  not  raise  a  question  of  law  of  public  or general 
importance  and  there  is  no  appearance  of  a  miscarriage  of  justice.   The  application 
for leave to appeal is therefore dismissed.
