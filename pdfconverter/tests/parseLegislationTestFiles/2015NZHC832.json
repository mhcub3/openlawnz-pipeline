He relies on r 15.1(c) and (d) of the High Court Rules, namely that the \nproceeding is frivolous or vexatious, or is an abuse of the process of the court. \n[2] The original statement of claim, undated but filed on 17 July 2014, ran to 17 \npages and contained hundreds of clauses and subclauses.  Mr Skelton has throughout \nbeen self-represented. \n[3] On 28 August 2014 Mr Nair applied to strike out Mr Skelton's statement  of \nclaim,  asserting  amongst  other  things  that  the statement  of  claim was  prolix, \nvexatious and an abuse of process. \n[4] When the case was called it was adjourned to give the plaintiff an opportunity \nto file an amended statement of claim.  An amended statement of claim was filed and \nserved on 3 November 2014, and it is that which is the subject of this application to \nstrike out. \n[5] The  ground  relied  on  is  that  the allegations  of  fact  which  the  claim  is  based \non were the subject of a full and comprehensive settlement in earlier proceedings in \nthis court filed under CIV-2006-404-2924 and CIV-2007-404-5247.   It is stated that \nthe  terms  of  the settlement are  a  complete  bar  to  the  claim  and  accordingly  it  is \nfrivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process.   \n[6] It appears that in 2006 Mr Skelton and his wife at the time were involved in \nlitigation.    Mr  Nair  is  a  chartered accountant and  he  was ultimately  appointed  as  a \nreceiver of a partnership known as the Urban and Country Partnership (UCP) which \nwas in effect a partnership of the respective trusts of Mr and Mrs Skelton. \n[7] Mr  Nair  commenced proceedings  in  his  name  as receiver  of  UCP,  against \nMr Skelton's trust and another associated trust, seeking recovery against the trustees \nof $439,000.   [8] There  was  a settlement conference  on  4  August  2008  before  an  Associate \nJudge.   Settlement was  reached  and  a  heads  of agreement was executed  by  the \nparties.    There  were  then  two  later  deeds  of settlement on  30  August  2008  and  in \nFebruary 2009.  There were complete settlement clauses in the August and February \nagreements.  It is submitted for Mr Nair that in the light of the settlements that were \nreached and the agreement that all claims were at an end, this proceeding must fail as \nit is an attempt to relitigate matters already resolved. \nApproach to strike out \n[9] The  criteria  to  be  applied  in  a strike  out application are  well  settled.    In \nAttorney-General v Prince and Gardner the Court of Appeal held:1 A striking-out application proceeds on the assumption that the facts pleaded \nin the statement of claim are true.  That is  so even  although they are  not or \nmay not be admitted.  It is well settled that before the Court may strike  out \nproceedings  the  causes  of  action  must  be  so  clearly  untenable  that  they \ncannot  possibly  succeed;  the  jurisdiction  is  one  to  be exercised  sparingly, \nand  only  in  a  clear  case  where  the Court is  satisfied  it  has  the  requisite \nmaterial; but the fact that applications to strike out raise difficult questions of \nlaw, and require extensive argument does not exclude jurisdiction.  [10] Although  facts  are  generally  assumed  to  be  true,  this  does  not  mean  that \nevery statement in  a  pleading  must  be accepted without examination.    Provided  the \nchallenge to a pleading is based on uncontested or uncontestable material the Courts \nwill  engage  with  the  facts  more  freely.    In  this  case  certain  background  factual \nmaterial has been placed before the Court without objection. \n[11] In  certain circumstances uncontested affidavit evidence can  be  filed  and \nrelied on by a Court considering  a strike out application.   It was stated in Attorney-\nGeneral v McVeagh:2 The   Court   is   entitled   to   receive   affidavit   evidence   on   a   striking   out \napplication,  and  will  do  so  in  a  proper  case.    It  will  not  attempt  to  resolve \ngenuinely disputed issues of fact and therefore will generally limit evidence \nto  that  which  is  undisputed.    Normally  it  will  not  consider  evidence \ninconsistent with the pleading, for a striking out application is dealt with on \nthe  footing  that  the  pleaded  facts  can  be  proved.   But  there  may  be  a  case                                                  1  Attorney-General v Prince and Gardner [1998] 1 NZLR 262 (CA) at 267 (citations omitted). 2  Attorney-General  v  McVeagh [1995]  1  NZLR  558  (CA)  at  566  (citations  omitted,  emphasis \nadded).   where   an   essential factual   allegation   is   so   demonstrably   contrary   to \nindisputable fact that the matter ought not to be allowed to proceed further. The amended statement of claim \n[12] Mr  Skelton's  amended statement   of   claim sets   out   the   background   to \nMr Nair's involvement and then refers to an apartment in Australia in which the \nSkelton interests owned a half share.  The statement of claim pleads that on 18 May \n2007  Mr  Nair  entered  into  an agreement to  sell  to  one  of  the  other  owners, \nMr Howcroft, and his spouse, the one half share  in the apartment.   It is alleged that \nMr Nair did not disclose the existence of the agreement to Mr Skelton.  Mr Skelton \nthen refers to the settlement agreement of 4 August 2008 as a \"heads of agreement\" \nand  asserts  that  at  the  time  of  signing  the  head  of agreement he  was  \"of  the \nimpression  that  the  sale of  the  one  half  share  in  the  apartment  had  not  yet occurred \nbut  was  still  an  offer  only\".    He  pleads  that  unbeknown  to  him  the  sale  to \nMr Howcroft had been completed and the proceeds of sale distributed.  He pleads: The defendant had a duty to disclose to the plaintiff, trustee of the ROT, all \nmaterial information in  relation to  his activities,  including  in relation to  the \nsale of the one-half share in the apartment and the two subsequent variations \nof the Agreement. \nThe defendant failed  to  disclose  any  of  the  foregoing information to  the \nplaintiff. \nHad the plaintiff been aware of the above state of affairs, he would not have \nsigned  the  heads  of Agreement  settling  all  claims  that  he  had  or  may  have \nhad  against the other parties,  including the defendant, particularly as  one  of \nthe beneficiaries of the ROT was an infant. \nThe plaintiff signed  that document because of  the defendant's  failure  to \ndisclose  to him information which  he  had  a  duty  to  disclose,  and  while \nsubject  to  extreme  psychological  pressure  exerted  on  him  to  do  so  by  the \ndefendant,  in  concert  with others,  including  C  M  Howcroft,  the purchaser \nfrom the defendant of the one-half share in the Australian apartment owned \nby the ROT and the OTT. [13] He  then  goes  on  to  assert  that  at  the  time  of  the agreement to  sell  to \nMr Howcroft  there  was another available buyer  who  was  willing  to  pay  more,  and \nthat Mr Nair failed to make an adequate effort to obtain the best sale price and sold it \nundervalue.  Mr Skelton claims that as relief: i. An  order  setting  aside  the  Heads  of Agreement  dated  4 August  2007, \nsigned by the plaintiff;   ii. Damages   in   the   sum   of   the   New   Zealand   dollar   equivalent   of \nA$34,987.50,  being  one-half  of  the  sum  of  A$69,975,  the  difference \nbetween the  price  at  which  the defendant sold  the  apartment,  and  the \namount that an available buyer was willing to pay for it; \niii. Damages; \niv. Aggravated and/or punitive damages; \nv. Costs of and incidental to this proceeding. [14] The  only particularised failure on Mr Nair's part set out in this amended \nstatement  of  claim is  sale  at  an  undervalue,  being  the  sale  to  Mr  Howcroft  for \n$380,025. \nThe settlement agreements \n[15] I  turn  to  the settlement agreements  relied  on  by  Mr  Werry  for  Mr  Nair.  \nMr Skelton did not in his short affidavit or in his submissions seek to contest the fact \nthat he had signed the settlement agreements.  This is uncontested evidence and it is \nproperly relied on by Mr Werry in his submissions. \n[16] The settlement agreement reached through a judicial  settlement  conference \nafter the entering into of the agreement to sell to Mr Howcroft, referred in the recitals \nto  the receiver  completing  the  sale  and  the  parties  signing  all documents  and  doing \nall things necessary to facilitate completion.  It contained this clause at paragraph 14: This Agreement and completion of settlement in its terms are accepted by all \nparties  in full satisfaction of all claims  and  obligations  now or in the  future \ninter  partes,  as  between  the  trusts  referred  to  herein  and  as  between  the \nReceiver,  the  trusts  and  parties  herein  or  by  Bevin  or  Marie  against  any \nfamily trust of which the other has been a beneficiary.   And at paragraph 19: The parties to this deed acknowledge that all claims they may have whether \npresent or future, arising out of the receivership and the Receiver's entry into \nthis  Deed  of  Settlement  are  fully  and  finally  settled  upon execution  of  this \ndeed.  [17] It was stated in the variation of 30 August 2008 that the terms and conditions \nof  the  earlier agreement would  remain  in  full  force  and effect.    In  the agreement of \n25 February 2009 there was a new final settlement clause which provided as follows:   This agreement and  completion  of  the settlement in  its  terms  and  the \nsubsisting terms of the agreement dated 4 August 2008 and 30 August 2008 \nare accepted  by  all  parties  in  full  and  final satisfaction  of  all  claims  and \nobligations now or in the future as between the trusts referred to herein and \nas  between  the  receiver,  the  trusts  and  parties  herein  or  by  either  Bevin  or \nMarie   against   any   family   trust   of   which   the   other  is  or   has   been  a \nbeneficiary.  [18] These agreements  were  signed  by  Mr  Skelton  \"in all  capacities\".    They \nunambiguously settled between Mr Nair and Mr Skelton all claims that relate to the \nsale to Mr Howcroft. \n[19] In addition to the settlement agreement referring to the Howcroft agreement, \nMr  Skelton  in  an affidavit sworn  on  25  March  2008, some  months  before  the  first \nsettlement agreement, expressly referred to the Howcroft agreement and stated: I do not consider that the receiver has sought to obtain the best price for the \nMain Beach property.  Strike out  \n[20] It seems plain then that the very issue that Mr Skelton now complains about, \nnamely impropriety or negligence in the sale to Howcroft, was at issue in the earlier \nproceedings  and  expressly  settled  on  a  final  basis  in  the settlement agreements.  \nFurther,  the settlement was  expressed  in  the broadest  terms  that  covered  all  matters \nat issue between Mr Nair and Mr Skelton. \n[21] In his submissions Mr Skelton argued that he did not understand all the issues \nthat  had  arisen  in relation to  the  Howcroft agreement.   However,  with  one possible \nexception  that  I  will  refer  to,  the  pleading  does  not  set  out  any material non-\ndisclosures, and in any event the very wide terms of the settlement clauses expressly \ncover  future  claims.    The  intention  was  clearly  to  settle  all  claims  relating  to  the \nHowcroft agreement,  then  existing  or  arising  in  the  future,  and  indeed  the  fact  that \nthe settlement is  for  all  claims  and obligations  \"in  the  future\"  is  spelled  out  in \nparagraph 19  of  the settlement agreement and paragraph 12  of  the agreement of \n25 February 2009. \n[22] There was a pleading in paragraph 17 of the statement of claim that Mr Nair \nfailed  to  disclose  to  Mr Skelton information which  he  had  a  duty  to  disclose.    However,  the  pleading  did  not  specify  any information that should have  been \ndisclosed and was not disclosed, and indeed in submissions Mr Skelton did not refer \nto  any  such specific information.    What  he  submitted  was  that  he  would  need \ndiscovery to  find  out  the necessary details.   However,  issuing proceedings  in  the \nspeculative  hope  that something in discovery might  reveal  a  cause  of  action  is  an \nabuse  of  the  pleading process and  a general allegation lacking  any  detail  or \nfoundation cannot disclose a cause of action. \n[23] While it could be said that a notional cause of action was disclosed of sale by \nMr  Nair at  an  undervalue,  Mr  Nair  appears  to  have  a defence that  is  uncontestable \nand  certain  to  succeed,  namely  that  any  claims  relating  to  the  Howcroft agreement \nwere  settled.    It  is  an  abuse  of  procedure  to  pursue  court  claims  that  have  been \ncompromised by a binding settlement.3 \n[24] Further,  there  are  various  hallmarks  indicating  this proceeding is  a  frivolous \nand vexatious proceeding.  The delay in issuing these proceedings was not explained.  \nThe  first statement  of  claim was  extraordinarily  prolix  and  diffuse.    The amended \nstatement of claim was more focused, but it addresses an issue that has already been \nthe   subject   of   litigation   which   has   been   settled, and raises speculative   and \nunspecified allegations.  Plainly it cannot succeed. \nResult \n[25] The proceedings are struck out. \nCosts  \n[26] Indemnity costs  were  sought  for  Mr  Nair.   Although I  found  the proceeding \nwas  frivolous  and  an  abuse  of process,  the application has  been  brought  to hearing \nquickly and there has been no particular action on Mr Skelton's part, apart from the \nfiling  of  the proceedings,  which  has  constituted  vexatious  or  frivolous behaviour.  \nOn  the  assumption  that this  was  a  one-off  error  of  judgment on Mr Skelton's part I  \n \n                                                 3  See for example Peterson v Lucas Mills Pty Ltd [2014] NZCA 6 at [6].    have decided I will not order indemnity costs.  Mr Skelton will pay standard costs on \na 2B basis to Mr Nair, together with reasonable disbursements.   \n \n \n \n................................... \n     Asher J ",
