The  order  is  sought  because  her\nfirm (PricewaterhouseCoopers) provides services to a number of secured creditors of\nthe companies that are proposing to appoint her.\n[2] The services provided by her firm are a potentially disqualifying factor under\ns 281(cb) of the Act.\n[3] The Court has also to consider whether to grant leave to bring the application\nby  way  of  originating  application  and  whether  it  is  appropriate  to  determine  these\nmatters ex parte.\nBackground\n[4] The  applicant  is  an  insolvency  practitioner  with  over  20  years  experience.\nShe  is  a  director  of  PricewaterhouseCoopers,  and  is  responsible  for  that  firm's\nAuckland liquidation practice.\n[5] The applicant has been asked by the shareholders of the companies to accept\nappointment  as  liquidator  for  the  companies.    The  companies  are  part  of  a  larger\ngroup of companies (known as the Kensington Group).  The applicant already holds\nappointment as liquidator of a number of other companies in that group.\n[6] Since  being  approached  the  applicant  has  made  enquiries  to  determine\nwhether  she  is  qualified  to  accept  the  appointment.    She  has  come  to  the  view  that\nshe  is  potentially  disqualified  by  reason  only  of  the  fact  that  her  firm  provides  a\nvariety of services to a number of secured creditors of the companies.\nLeave to bring under Part 4A\n[7] A proceeding may be brought under Part 4A of the High Court Rules if it is\nspecifically  authorised  under  r  458D  or  by  leave  of  the  Court  under  r  458D(1)(e).\nThe  applicant  is  required  to  seek  leave  to  bring  this  proceeding  because  there  is  noexpress  provision  for  it  under  r  458D.  It  cannot  be  regarded  as  an  application  for\ndirections  by  a  liquidator,  for  which  there  is  express  provision  in  r  458D(1)(d)(i)),\nbecause the applicant is not yet appointed.\n[8] The  criterion  for  granting  leave  is  whether  it  is  in  the  interests  of  justice:  r\n458D(1)(e).  There is ample precedent for granting leave for applications under s 280\nor  s  286  of  the  Act,  and  on  an  ex  parte  basis:  Re  Mountain  View  Developments\nLimited (in liquidation), ex parte I O Caddis HC AK M1730/00, 21 November 2000,\nChambers  J;  Bridgecorp  Holdings  Limited  v  Goodman  Limited  HC  AK  CIV  2007-\n404-4866, 9 August 2007, Courtney J; Re Fatupaito and McCloy HC AK CIV 2007-\n404-7330,  29  November  2007,  Associate  Judge  Robinson;  Re  D  &  F  Contracting\nLimited  ex  parte  Blanchard  and  Fatupaito  HC  AK  2008-404-5443,  18  September\n2008, Associate Judge Doogue.\n[9] I  am  satisfied  that  it  is  appropriate  to  deal  with  the  application  for  leave  ex\nparte,  and  that  leave  ought  to  be  granted,  having  regard  to  the  nature  of  the\napplication (an application for directions).  I also take into account that creditors (the\nparties  most  likely  to  have  an  interest  in  the  application)  will  receive  notice  of  the\napplication at the same time as notice of the first creditors' meeting, and the matters\nadvanced  for  proceeding  ex  parte  on  the  substantive  application  (which  I  will  now\naddress).\nSubstantive proceeding ex parte\n[10] The applicant asks that the substantive application be determined ex parte on\nthe grounds set out in r 256(2)(a), (c) and (e) of the High Court Rules:\nThe Court may determine that an application can properly be dealt with on an\nex parte basis only if the Court is satisfied that—\n(a) requiring the applicant to proceed on notice would cause undue delay\nor prejudice to the applicant; or\n...\n(c) the application relates to a routine matter; or\n...\n(e)  the  interests  of  justice  require  the  application  to  be  determined\nwithout serving notice of the application.[11] I accept that it is appropriate to proceed ex parte on the ground that it is in the\ninterests  of  justice  to  do  so.    I  do  not  see  that  r  256(2)(a)  applies  as  I  read  it  as\nrequiring  undue  delay  or  prejudice  to  the  applicant  (as  distinct  from  others  such  as\ncreditors)  and  a  case  for  that  has  not  been  made  out.    I  have  recently  expressed  the\nview  that  these  applications  are  not  merely  routine,  as  each  case  must  be  carefully\nconsidered  by  the  Court:  Re  Joeleen  Enterprises  Limited,  ex  parte  Blanchett  and\nFatupaito (CIV 2008-443-000485, 3 October 2008).\n[12] The  factors  which,  in  my  view,  warrant  the  matter  being  dealt  with  ex  parte\nare:\na) The shareholders of the companies are seeking urgent appointment as\nthey consider the companies to be insolvent;\nb) It is likely that there will be a large number of creditors (although the\nnumber  and  level  has  not  yet  been  ascertained  because  of  difficulties\nobtaining  access  to  the  computer  system  of  the  companies)  and  the\nsignificant costs involved in effecting service are more likely to be to\nthe detriment rather than the benefit of creditors;\nc) The financial position of the companies may deteriorate further while\nservice is being effected, again to the prejudice of creditors;\nd) Directors  are  potentially  prejudiced  (by  possible  personal  liability  if\nthe  companies  continue  to  trade),  and  their  responsibility  in  placing\nthe companies into liquidation promptly should be recognised; and\ne) The creditors' positions will be preserved by them being given notice\nof  the  application  at  the  same  time  as  notice  of  the  first  creditors'\nmeeting and by leave being reserved for them to apply to set aside the\napplicant's  appointment  (they  also  have  the  right  to  remove  the\napplicant at the creditors' meeting).The substantive application\n[13] The  need  for  the  present  application  arises  under  s  280(1)(cb)  of  the  Act.\nThat section reads:280Qualifications of liquidators\n(1)Unless  the  Court  orders  otherwise,  none  of  the  following  persons\nmay be appointed or act as a liquidator of a company:\n...\n(cb)a  person  who  has,  or  whose  firm  has,  within  the  2  years\nimmediately  before  the  commencement  of  the  liquidation,\nhad  a  continuing  business  relationship  (other  than  through\nthe  provision  of  banking  or  financial  services)  with  the\ncompany,  its  majority  shareholder,  any  of  its  directors,  or\nany of its secured creditors, unless, within 20 working days\nbefore  the  appointment  of  the  liquidator,  the  board  of  the\ncompany resolves that the company will, on the appointment\nof  the  liquidator,  be  able  to  pay  its  debts  and  a  copy  of  the\nresolution is delivered to the Registrar for registration:[14] The  present  application  is  brought  both  under  the  introductory  phrase  of\ns  280  ('Unless  the  Court  orders  otherwise')  and  pursuant  to  s  286  of  the  Act,  the\nrelevant parts of which read:286Orders to enforce liquidator's duties\n(1)An application for an order under this section may be made by—\n...\n(b) A person seeking appointment as a liquidator:\n...\n(4)A  Court  may,  in  relation  to  a  person  who  ...  is  or  becomes\ndisqualified  under  section  280  of  this  Act  to  become  or  remain  a\nliquidator,—\n...\n(b)Order  that  the  person  may  be  appointed  and  act,  or  may\ncontinue to act, as liquidator, notwithstanding the provisions\nof section 280 of this Act.[15] In paragraphs [11] to [15] of my decision in Re Joeleen Enterprises Limited I\nreviewed   recent   decisions   dealing   with   the   'continuing   business   relationship'disqualification  set  out  in  s  280(1)(cb)  of  the  Act  (my  decision  in  Icon  Digital\nEntertainment  Limited  v  Westpac  New  Zealand  Limited  (HC  AK  CIV  2007-404-\n7124,  20  November  2007);  Re  Fatupaito  and  McCloy;  and Re  D  &  F  Contracting\nLimited).  I summarised the position as follows:[15]There  is  no  definition  of  'a  continuing  business  relationship'  in  the  Act.\nThe   cases   I   have   just   reviewed   indicate   that   the   Court   will   decide   on   the\ncircumstances of each case whether there is such a relationship, and whether it is of\nsuch a nature and degree that a person should not be appointed.  The Court will have\nparticular   regard   to   whether   the   person   or   persons   seeking   appointment   (or\ncontinuation of an appointment) have a direct relationship or whether it is merely by\nvirtue  of  their  involvement  in  a  firm.    It  will  clearly  be  a  relevant  consideration\nwhether  or  not  any  other  member  of  the  firm  could  have  a  role  in  the  decisions  or\nadministration of the liquidation.[16] The applicant has identified a range of general financial and taxation services\nand  advice  provided  by  her  firm  to  the  various  secured  creditors  of  the  companies.\nShe is not involved in the provision of these services.  None of the services relates to\nthe companies to which she seeks appointment or to the wider group, nor to the sole\ndirector  of  these  companies,  nor  to  any  shareholders  in  them.    Further,  as  an\nadditional precaution, the applicant states that no member of her firm who has been\ninvolved in providing the services will be permitted to be involved in the liquidation\nof the companies.\n[17] I   accept,   on   the   facts   of   this   case,   that   the   provision   of   services   by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers to secured creditors of the companies will not compromise\nthe applicant's independence, or her ability to carry out her task as liquidator of the\ncompanies  professionally  and  effectively.    I  do  not  see  that  her  appointment  will\ncause risk to creditors or any other third parties, but accept that they should be given\nthe opportunity to challenge the appointment if they consider they have grounds for\ndoing  so.  For  the  reasons  I  have  given  I  do  not  see  any  need  to  identify  and\ndetermine  any  issue  prior  to  the  appointment.    It  is  sufficient,  in  my  view,  that  that\nopportunity  is  available  to  them  immediately  following  her  appointment.    The\ndirections as to service proposed by the applicant are appropriate.\n[18] In  weighing  up  whether  or  not  to  exercise  my  discretion,  I  also  take  into\naccount the following:a) The applicant's experience and professional standing, and the fact that\nher firm (of chartered accountants) are subject to rules of professional\nconduct.\nb) The potential benefits of appointing a single liquidator (or a single set\nof liquidators) to a group of companies where there is no obvious and\nreal   conflict:   Re   Arrows   Limited   [1992]   BCC   121;   Australian\nSecurities  &  Investments  Commission  v  Westpoint  Corporation  Pty\nLimited (2006) 56 ACSR 646.\nc) The  facts  of  the  case  suggest  there  could  be  significant  efficiencies,\nand  therefore  benefit  to  creditors,  in  the  applicant's  appointment  (all\nof  the  companies  are  involved  in  a  failed  large  scale  residential\ndevelopment in Orewa known as Kensington Park, and have the same\nmanagement structure).\nDecision\n[19] I make the following orders (as sought):\na) For  leave  to  commence  this  proceeding  by  way  of  an  ex  parte\noriginating application;\nb) That pursuant to s 280 and/or s 286(4)(b) of the Companies Act 1993\n(the   Act)   Vivian   Judith   Fatupaito   may   act   as   liquidator   of   the\nfollowing companies:\ni) Kensington Construction Limited\nii) Kensington Properties Limited;\niii) De Berri Group Limited;\niv) Huka Village Limited;v) Kensington Residential Orakei Limited;\nvi) Kensington Residential Upland Limited;\nvii) Kensington Residential Kohimarama Limited;\nviii) Harbourside Properties Limited;\n(together the companies);\nc) That  the  originating  application  and  orders  be  served  on  all  known\ncreditors  of  each  of  the  companies  at  the  same  time  and  in  the  same\nmanner as the liquidator's first report under s 255 of the Act;\nd) That the creditors of any of the companies are granted leave to apply\nto the Court within five working days of such service to set aside the\napplicant's appointment as liquidator of the company which he, she or\nit is a creditor of; and\ne) That  the  applicant's  solicitor/client  costs  of  this  application  be  an\nexpense  incurred  by  the  applicant  in  carrying  out  her  duties  as  a\nliquidator of the companies.\n____________________\nAssociate Judge Abbott",
