J N Black     Introduction 
[1] I refer to my reserved judgment of 22 May 2018.1  I found in favour of the 
plaintiff liquidators and held that the first, second and third defendants, as directors – 
whether de jure, de facto or shadow – of Wenztro Co-operation Limited (in liquidation) 
(Wenztro), had breached ss 135, 136 and 137 of the Companies Act 1993.  I made 
orders requiring them to repay to the company the amount claimed by the liquidators 
in the fourth amended statement of claim together with interest.  Further, I recorded 
that the plaintiff liquidators, as successful parties, were entitled to costs and I put in 
place a timetable for the filing of memoranda in that regard. 
[2] On 6 June 2018, the liquidators through counsel filed a lengthy memorandum 
with voluminous schedules seeking costs on a 2B basis, together with a 50 per cent 
uplift.  The amounts sought were as follows: 
(a) the costs of the proceeding – $134,676 (including uplift); 
(b) disbursements – $19,709; 
(c) costs incurred by the liquidators in the administration of Wenztro's 
affairs – $236,409.84; 
(d) disbursements incurred by the liquidators – $3,343.73; 
(e) the  liquidators'  costs  in  reconstructing  the  financial  accounts  of 
Wenztro – $1,495; and 
(f) interest on the judgment debt from the date of liquidation and post-
judgment – $216,682.08. 
The total amount the liquidators sought to recover by way of a costs order, including 
interest as at 6 June 2018, amounted to $612,315.65. 
                                                 1  Finnigan v Ellis [2018] NZHC 1146.   [3] Mr  Pyke  filed  a  memorandum  in  reply  on  behalf  of  the  first  defendant, 
Mr  Ellis, on 21 June 2018.  Nothing was filed by either Mr Williams or Mr Black. 
[4] Given the scope of the orders sought, and some of the concerns raised by 
Mr  Pyke, I directed a further hearing in relation to costs.   
[5] The liquidators then filed yet a further memorandum through counsel, with 
more voluminous schedules, seeking to clarify some of the sums sought.   
[6] The hearing proceeded on 12 September 2018.   
[7] I  deal  first  with  the  costs  of  the  proceedings,  then  with  the  costs  of  the 
liquidation and then with interest. 
Costs of the proceeding 
[8] Costs of a proceeding are, of course, at the discretion of the Court – r 14.1(1) 
of the High Court Rules.  That discretion is not unfettered.  It is qualified by the 
specific costs rules contained in rr 14.2 to 14.10.   
[9] In this case, the starting point is r 14.2(1)(a).  It provides that the party who 
fails with respect to a proceeding should pay the costs of the party who succeeds.   
[10] Here,  the  liquidators  succeeded  in  their  proceeding.    The  amount  they 
recovered  on behalf  of  Wenztro  was  only  part  of  the  sum  when  the  hearing 
commenced.  However, in such situations, success, even on more limited terms, is still 
treated as success.2  I do not consider that the liquidators are disentitled to costs as a 
result of the fact that they only partially achieved the result they set out to achieve.   
[11] There is no dispute that costs should be fixed on a 2B basis.  There is a helpful 
schedule setting out the amount claimed.  It is Schedule 1 to the memorandum filed 
                                                 2  Weaver v Auckland Council [2017] NZCA 330 at [26].   on behalf of the liquidators dated 6 June 2018.  The only matters disputed in the 
calculation of costs set out in that schedule were as follows:3 
(a) Item 3 – the liquidators claimed separately but against all defendants 
for the filing of replies to the statements of defences filed by each of 
the three defendants.   
(b) Item  9 – the  liquidators  claimed  separately  but  also  against  all 
defendants for filing responses to the amended pleadings filed by each 
of the defendants.   
(c) Items 34 and 35 – the liquidators claimed for nine days of hearing time.   
[12] I agree with the defendants in relation to these matters.   
[13] Each defendant should only be expected to bear the costs properly payable by 
him, and each should not be jointly and severally liable for costs properly attributable 
to others.  Items 3 and 9 claim costs jointly, where the costs are attributable to each 
defendant individually.  By way of example, in my judgment, Mr Ellis should not be 
liable to meet the costs of the liquidators in filing replies to the statements of defence 
filed by Mr Williams and by Mr Black.   
[14] I also agree with the assertion that there should be a reduction in the hearing 
time to reflect the significant reduction in quantum between the amount claimed at the 
start of the hearing and the amount in respect of which judgment was awarded.   
[15] As I recorded in my substantive judgment, the amount claimed varied – starting 
at $773,135.26, rising to $2,778,124.80, and finally being fixed at $765,692.81.4  The 
background to these changes of stance by the liquidators is relevant.  Initially, they 
sought to recover amounts said to be owed by the company, including a judgment debt 
which  had  been  obtained  by  Wenzhou  Hongliang  Trading  Co  Ltd  (WHT)  of 
                                                 3  In his memorandum, Mr Pyke did dispute item 1 – commencement of proceedings – as well, but 
this was not pursued at the hearing, and I cannot see that there can be any argument taken with 
this item in any event. 4  Finnigan v Ellis, above n 1, at [4].   $617,396.61.  They then added in two large unsecured claims – one made by WHT 
and the other by Sunlucky Style NZ Ltd.  These additional amounts were said to be 
consequential losses following on from Wenztro's breach of contract.  This took the 
total  claim  to  approximately  $2,750,000.    It  became  clear  in  the  course  of 
Ms  Finnigan's evidence that WHT had already obtained judgment against Wenztro 
for its breach of contract.  It seemed to me that WHT might be belatedly seeking to 
recover additional damages, and that the rule in Henderson v Henderson might apply.5  
I raised this issue with counsel.  Mr Crossland, appearing for the liquidators, filed a 
memorandum disputing the application of Henderson v Henderson, and arguing that 
there were circumstances which meant that the rule set out in that case was not 
applicable.  The case then proceeded (although fatuitously the liquidators' expert, who 
was to deal with the consequential losses claimed, was unavailable and it was agreed 
that  he  could  give  his  evidence  after  the  defendants  had  called  their  evidence).  
Sometime later, Mr Pyke opened the defence for Mr Ellis.  In the course of his opening, 
he also referred to the rule in Henderson v Henderson and to more recent authorities 
upholding the rule.  Shortly thereafter, Mr Crossland abandoned the claim to the 
consequential losses and filed a fourth amended statement of claim reducing the 
amount claimed to $765,692.81.  The liquidators obtained judgment in this sum 
together with interest. 
[16] Had WHT – as the party funding the liquidators – been aware that its claim 
was limited to this lesser sum from the outset, it may be that it would not have funded 
and pursued the litigation.  As a matter of commercial common sense, any return from 
the proceedings might not have justified the outlay.  The liquidators did not, however, 
abandon the claim.  Rather, they proceeded, but they did not call expert evidence in 
relation to the consequential losses claimed.   
[17] I consider that the change of position by the liquidators did increase the costs 
of the defendants.  Ms Finnigan gave evidence of the consequential losses claimed.  
So did Ms Wang.  Other than this, much the same evidence would have been required 
regardless of the amount claimed.  The defendants, and in particular Mr Ellis, did incur 
                                                 5  Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 (Ch) at 115.   some cost in dealing with the Henderson v Henderson issue because they had to 
research the matter.  Some time was taken at the hearing dealing with this issue.   
[18] Pursuant to r 14.7(d), I have a discretion to refuse costs or to reduce the costs 
otherwise payable, given that the liquidators failed in relation to an issue, if that issue 
significantly increased the costs of the defendants opposing costs.   
[19] In my judgment, the liquidators' initial mistake as to quantum did significantly 
increase the costs for the defendants.  It required additional pleadings.  Unnecessary 
time was taken with witnesses who gave evidence in relation to the issue.  Legal 
argument was required.  The time taken for the hearing was extended by – in my broad 
estimate – one day.  As a result, I reduce the number of hearing days the liquidators 
can seek costs for to eight days. 
[20] There was no dispute about the disbursements claimed. 
[21] The total costs claimed by the liquidators in Schedule 1 to the 6 June 2018 
memorandum, calculated on a 2B basis, without uplift, were $100,419.  I deduct from 
that sum the costs claimed for items 3 and 9, and reduce the number of days from nine 
to eight.  That reduces the costs properly claimable against all defendants on a joint 
and several basis to $89,423.  In addition, each of the defendants is liable for $2,922 
individually – being the total of the item 3 and item 9 costs attributable to each 
defendant.  The  defendants  will  also  be  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the 
disbursements claimed – $19,709. 
[22] I now turn to the claim for increased costs.  
[23] I agree with the liquidators that the defendants unnecessarily contributed to the 
duration and expense of the proceeding.  By way of example, they put the liquidators 
to proof of every aspect of the claim, and failed to respond to a notice from the 
liquidators to admit facts, most, if not all of which were non-controversial.  They 
brought applications to increase the security for costs, even though the time for making 
such applications had expired.  They failed to comply with discovery orders in a timely 
fashion.  They chose not to liaise with the liquidators on the proposed index for the   documents to be included in the common bundle.  Some of the matters pursued at the 
hearing by the defendants were irrelevant – for example, an allegation that WHT had 
stolen the intellectual property in the Promax brand, when the evidence was clear that 
that brand had never been registered in China by Wenztro.  They attempted to relitigate 
in part matters already dealt with in WHT's summary judgment proceedings.  All of 
these matters put the liquidators to additional costs.   
[24] In addition, there were some matters particular to individual defendants.  For 
example, Mr Ellis attempted to belatedly lodge an amended proof of debt which he 
later withdrew.  Some of Mr Williams' cross-examination was not well-directed.  
Mr  Black made various allegations against Mr Lin and Ms Taylor which were not 
causes of action open to him. 
[25] Pursuant to r 4.6(3)(b)(i) to (iii), I can award increased costs if the parties 
opposing  costs  have  contributed  unnecessarily  to  the  time  or  expense  of  the 
proceeding, for example by failing to comply with the Rules or directions of the Court, 
taking or pursuing unnecessary steps or matters that lacked merit, and failing without 
reasonable justification to admit facts, evidence or documents.   
[26] I am satisfied that costs were increased as a result of the defendants' conduct 
noted above, that r 4.6 is engaged, and that an award of increased costs is appropriate. 
[27] The correct approach in such cases6 is to first categorise the proceeding under 
r 14.3.  Here, that has been done.  These proceedings are 2B proceedings.  There is no 
longer any dispute as to what is a reasonable time for each step in the proceeding under 
r 14.5.  No extra time for any particular step is claimed.  I am satisfied that it is 
appropriate  to  award  increased  costs  of  25  per  cent  of  the  costs  for  which  the 
defendants are jointly and severally liable.  I do not make any uplift for matters 
particular  to  each  defendant.    They  were  not  of  any  great  moment,  they  were 
compensated  for  by  other  matters,  for  example  Mr  Ellis  acknowledged  that  the 
securities he held were voidable, and Messrs Williams and Black were by and large 
economical in their respective contributions to the hearing.  
                                                 6  Holdfast NZ Ltd v Selleys Pty Ltd (2005) 17 PRNZ 897 (CA).   [28] I award costs in favour of the liquidators and against the defendants as follows: 
(a) the defendants are jointly and severally liable for costs in the sum of 
$111,778.75 (being the base costs award of $89,423, plus a 25 per cent 
uplift); 
(b) Mr Ellis is liable for an additional $2,922; 
(c) Mr Williams is liable for an additional $2,922; 
(d) Mr Black is liable for an additional $2,922; and 
(e) the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the disbursements in 
the sum of $19,709. 
Liquidators' claims for the costs of the liquidation 
[29] Ms Boparoy, for the liquidators, acknowledged that the costs of the liquidation 
were not specifically sought in the pleadings.  She nevertheless asserted that they fell 
within the prayers for relief to each cause of action.  Relevantly, each of the prayers 
for relief sought the following: A. An  order  under  s  301(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  Companies Act  1993  that  [the 
directors]  contribute  to  the  assets  of  the  company  in  the  amount  of 
$765,692.81 or such other sum as the Court thinks just. 
... 
C. Costs and disbursements. [30] I do not accept Ms Boparoy's argument.  Nowhere in the statement of claim is 
there any express reference to the costs of the liquidation.  Nor was any evidence 
adduced in the course of the hearing detailing the liquidators' costs.  Rather, the 
liquidators have belatedly sought to recover their costs from the defendants by filing 
voluminous schedules to memoranda filed on their behalf and by making factual 
assertions as to those costs through counsel.  The end result is that the defendants were 
not on notice of the claim for the liquidators' costs at the relevant time.  They did not   know that they had to meet a claim for the liquidators' costs.  They did not call 
evidence in relation to the issue.  They did not cross-examine on the issue.   
[31] Ms Boparoy referred me to various authorities where liquidators have been 
awarded either in whole or in part the costs of liquidations under either ss 300 or 301 
of the Companies Act.   
[32] I have considered the various authorities.  They do not assist her.  In each, it is 
clear that the liquidators' costs in the liquidation were sought as part of the substantive 
proceedings.7  There is no dispute that the costs of a liquidation can be recovered as 
compensation under ss 300 or 301, although the position is not straightforward,8 but 
only where they are sought as part of the substantive proceedings.  Ms Boparoy could 
not point me to a single case where the liquidators' costs of a liquidation have been 
ordered as part of the costs of the proceedings, in situations where the liquidators' 
costs of the liquidation were not sought in the substantive proceedings. 
[33] I do not consider that the liquidators can now properly claim the costs of the 
liquidation as part of the costs of the proceeding.  To hold otherwise would be unfair 
to the defendants and a breach of the rules of natural justice because the defendants 
have not been heard on the quantum of those costs.  I observe that the position is not 
altogether lost for the liquidators.  They can still recover their costs – not as against 
the defendants by way of compensation, but rather from the company, pursuant to ss 
276 to 278 of the Companies Act and pursuant to the Companies Act 1993 Liquidation 
Regulations 1994.  That may be scant comfort for WHT, but any complaint it may 
have as a consequence should not be visited on the defendants.  The position is not of 
their making. 
                                                 7  Hansa Ltd (in liq) v Hibbs [2017] NZHC 2014 at [3](a), [8], [61], [67] and [69](b); Grant v Gifford 
[2018] NZHC 26 at [5], [28], [42]; TGM Trading Ltd (in liq) v Drever [2018] NZHC 1788 at [1], 
[5], [9] and [25]; GL Investment & Development Ltd (in liq) v Gao [2018] NZHC 868 at [7], [52] 
and [66]; EBR Holdings Ltd v van Duyn [2017] NZHC 1698 at [171]; Madsen-Ries v Petera [2015] 
NZHC 538 at [3] and [110]-[114]; Madsen-Ries v Twine [2015] NZHC 227 at [1], [9] and [10]; 
Shaw v Owens [2017] NZCA 315 at [8], [9], [16] and [17]; Willburn Furniture & Restorations Ltd 
(in liq) v Gledhill [2016] NZHC 331 at [16](d)(iii) and [78]; Central Tyres Waipukurau Ltd (in liq) 
v Pallesen [2016] NZHC 146 at [2], [3], [4](d) and [45]; Grant v Guo [2015] NZHC 2480 at [2] 
and [55]; Richard Geewiz Gee Consultants Ltd (in liq) v Gee [2014] NZHC 1483 at [7](d)(v) and 
[122]. 8  Shaw v Owens, above n 7, at [18].   [34] Accordingly, I make no award in respect of the costs of the liquidation or in 
respect of the disbursements incurred by the liquidators in the course of the liquidation.  
Nor do I make any award for the costs of reconstructing the financial accounts of 
Wenztro. 
Interest 
[35] I have already made orders in the substantive judgment in respect of interest.  
The calculation of interest is a matter for the parties.  The Court will only become 
involved if the parties cannot agree.  Interest on the judgment should not be put in 
issue in the context of a costs application. 
Conclusion 
[36] I award the costs of the proceedings to the liquidators in the sums set out above 
at [28].
