JUDGMENT OF THE COURT    
A Leave  is  granted  for  this  Court  to  consider  the  additional  question  (c)  in 
relation to the Vaughan Road Property Trust in CA474/2013. 
B The questions are answered as follows: 
1 Vaughan Road Property Trust (CA474/2013) 
(a)  Did  the  Courts  below  err  in  finding  that  the  Vaughan  Road 
Property Trust was illusory? 
Answer:  Yes,  but  Mr  Clayton's  right  to  exercise  his  general  power  of 
appointment  under  cl  7.1  of  the  trust  deed  was  "relationship 
property." 
(b)  Did  the  Courts  below  err  in  finding  the  Vaughan  Road  Property 
Trust was not a sham? 
Answer:  No. 
(c)  Is  Mrs  Clayton  entitled  to  a  compensation order  under  s  44C  of 
the  Property  (Relationships) Act  1976  in  relation  to  dispositions 
made to the Vaughan Road Property Trust? 
Answer:  It is unnecessary to answer this question. 
2 Education Trusts (CA474/2013) 
(a)  Was  there  any  disposition  of  property by  Mr  Clayton  to  the 
trustees  of  either  of  the  Stacey  Clayton  Education  Trust  and  the 
Anna Clayton Education Trust so as to support orders made under 
s 44 of the Property (Relationships) Act? 
Answer:  Yes. 
(b)  If  there  were  dispositions  made  for  the  purpose  of  land  acquired 
by  the  Stacey  Clayton  Education  Trust  and  the  Anna  Clayton 
Education Trust  with  the  intention  of  defeating  Mrs  Clayton's 
claim,  does  s  44(2)  of  the  Property  (Relationships) Act  authorise 
the  court  to  order  that  Mrs  Clayton  is  entitled  to  half  the  net   equity    of    the    Stacey    Clayton    Education    Trust    and    the 
Anna Clayton Education Trust? 
Answer:  Yes. 
3 Claymark Trust (CA438/2013) 
(a)  Is  Mrs  Clayton  entitled  to  a  compensation  order  under  s  44C  of 
the  Property  (Relationships) Act  in  relation  to  dispositions  made 
to the Claymark Trust? 
Answer:  No.  
(b)  Is  Mrs  Clayton  entitled  to  provision  from  the  assets  of  the 
Claymark  Trust  or  to  a  variation  of  that Trust,  applying  s  182  of 
the Family Proceedings Act 1980? 
Answer:  No. 
4 The Post-Separation Trusts (CA473/2013) 
Can  the  Court  be  satisfied  in  terms  of  s  44  of  the  Property  (Relationships) 
Act that there has been a disposition of property to any of the trustees of the 
Denarau  Resort Trust,  Sophia  No  7 Trust,  Chelmsford Trust  or  the  Lighter 
Quay 5B Trust by Mr Clayton in order to defeat Mrs Clayton's claim under 
the Act where those Trusts have been settled after the date of separation and 
where s 9(4) of the Property (Relationships) Act applies? 
Answer:   Yes  in  respect  of  the  Denarau  Resort  Trust  and  the  Sophia  No  7 
Trust.  Yes in respect of Mr Clayton's personal loan to the Chelmsford 
Trust.  No in respect of the VRPT's loan to the Chelmsford Trust.  No in 
respect of the Lighter Quay No 5 Trust. 
5 Valuation of business interests (CA474/2013) 
Did  the  Courts  below  err  in  finding  that,  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the 
value  of  business  interests,  an  EBITDA  of  $6,750,000  and  a  multiple  of 
6.25 per cent should be adopted? 
Answer:  No.   C The  issue  of  the  appropriate  order  to  be  made  under  s  44  of  the Property 
(Relationships)  Act  in  respect  of  the  Chelmsford  Trust  is  remitted  to  the 
High Court for determination in light of this judgment. 
D Issues of quantum are remitted to the High Court for determination in light 
of this judgment. 
E By consent, order D in the sealed High Court judgment is deleted. 
F The appellants in CA473/2013 and CA474/2013 must pay to the respondent 
in  those  appeals  75  per  cent  of  the  costs  in  respect  of  all  the  appeals  for  a 
complex appeal on a Band B basis with usual disbursements.  We certify for 
second counsel.

Introduction 
[1] This  appeal   concerns   nine  relationship  property  questions  arising  from 
judgments  of  the  Family  Court  and  the  High  Court.1  Leave  to  appeal  to  this  Court 
has been granted by the High Court and this Court.2 
[2] The  first  eight  questions  relate  to  various  trusts  established  by  the  first 
respondent in CA438/2013, Mr Clayton, both during his marriage to the appellant in 
CA438/2013,  Mrs  Clayton,  and  after  their  separation.    The  answers  to these 
questions  determine  whether  the  assets  of  the  trusts  are  Mr  Clayton's  separate 
property  as  he  claims  or  relationship  property  as  Mrs  Clayton  claims  in  which  case 
she will be entitled to half the value of their net equity. 
[3] The ninth question relates to the valuation of Mr Clayton's business interests 
held by his companies and trusts.  The parties are in agreement as to the appropriate 
valuation method, but disagree on two aspects of its application. 
[4] In  the  Courts  below  there  were  other  issues  in  dispute,  but  there  is  now 
agreement that: 
(a) An  ante-nuptial  agreement  set  aside  by  the  Family  Court  and  the 
High Court should remain set aside.3 
(b) Mr Clayton is entitled to $500,000 as his separate property. 
                                                 1  MAC  v  MAC FC  Rotorua  FAM-2007-063-652,  2  December  2011  [Family  Court  judgment]; 
Clayton v Clayton [2013] NZHC 301, [2013] 3 NZLR 236 [High Court judgment]. 2  Clayton v  Clayton [2013] NZHC 1529; Clayton v  Clayton [2013] NZCA 633 [Court of Appeal 
leave  judgment]; and Clayton v  Clayton CA438/2013, 17 July 2014 (Minute  of the  Court).  To 
the extent it is necessary to do so, we formally grant leave to consider the additional question (c) 
in relation to the Vaughan Road Property Trust. 3  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [29]â€“[35]; High Court judgment, above n 1, at [6]â€“[14].   (c) Mrs  Clayton  is  entitled  to  half  of  the  property  correctly classified  as 
relationship property. 
(d) The assets are to be valued as at 31 March 2011. 
(e) The  fair  market  value  of  Mr Clayton's  business  interests  is  to  be 
determined by the capitalisation of earnings methodology. 
(f) Issues   of   quantum   are   to   be   remitted   to   the   High   Court   for 
determination. 
[5] We  refer  briefly  to  the  factual  background  and  the  decisions  in  the  Courts 
below  before  considering  the  nine  questions.    We  address  the  submissions  for  the 
parties and the legal issues in the context of considering the nine questions. 
Factual background 
[6] Mr and Mrs Clayton separated in 2006 after 17 years of marriage.  They have 
two daughters, Stacey born in 1990 and Anna in 1994. 
Ownership of property during the marriage 
[7] During the marriage most of the parties' private property, including holiday 
homes and motor vehicles, was owned solely by entities associated with Mr Clayton, although he owned some assets, including the family home, personally. 
Mr Clayton's business interests 
[8] Mr  Clayton  is  a  successful  businessman  with  significant  sawmilling  and 
timber  processing  interests.    His  business  and  other  interests  are  owned  and 
controlled   by   a   number   of   companies   and   trusts   in   New   Zealand   and   the 
United States, including  Claymark  Industries  Ltd, Claymark  Finance  Ltd,  Claymark 
International Ltd, the Claymark Trust and the Vaughan Road Property Trust (VRPT). 
[9] The  shares  in  the  companies  are  owned  by  Mr  Clayton  directly  or  through 
trusts  in  which  he  is  a  trustee  and/or  beneficiary.   The  interrelationship  between   Mr Clayton's various companies and trusts is shown in a diagram included in the 
Family Court judgment.4 
[10] Mr  Clayton's  principal  advisers  have  included  the  fourth  appellant  in 
CA473/2013,  Mr  Bryan  Cheshire,  a  now  retired  chartered  accountant  who  was 
responsible, among other things, for the administration of all the trusts established by 
Mr  Clayton and  handled  day-to-day  running  of  the  VRPT  along  with  Mr  Bruce 
Warden,  another  chartered  accountant.  Mr  Clayton's  financial  adviser  since  2008 
and  his  accountant  since  2013  is  Mr  Giesbers  who  has  also  been chairman  of  the 
Claymark group of companies since 2008.  Mr Giesbers has had financial oversight 
of the Claymark group's  finances and responsibility  for preparing  their  financial 
statements. 
The trusts settled during the marriage 
[11] During the marriage Mr Clayton settled various discretionary trusts, three  of 
which have given rise to the current questions: 
(a) the Claymark Trust settled on 10 May 1994; 
(b) the VRPT settled on 14 June 1999; and 
(c) two separate education trusts for Stacey and Anna respectively settled 
in 2004. 
[12] It will be necessary to describe in some detail the terms of settlement and the 
operation of each of these trusts, but at this stage it is sufficient to note that: 
(a) Mr Clayton was the settlor and a trustee of each trust; 
(b) Mr    and    Mrs    Clayton    and    their    daughters    are    discretionary 
beneficiaries of the Claymark Trust and VRPT, but Mrs Clayton is not 
a beneficiary of the education trusts; 
                                                 4  At [14].   (c) the   trustees   of   each   trust   held   properties   closely   connected   to 
Mr Clayton's business interests; and  
(d) the  trusts  received  and  made  loans/advances  to  the  others  and  to 
Mr Clayton personally and his companies. 
The post-separation trusts 
[13] After Mr and Mrs Clayton separated, Mr Clayton settled the following further 
discretionary trusts: 
(a) The Denarau Resort Trust;  
(b) The Sophia No 7 Trust;  
(c) The Chelmsford Trust; and 
(d) The Lighter Quay 5B Trust. 
[14] Again it will be necessary  to describe in some detail the terms of settlement 
of  these  trusts.    At  this  stage  it  is  sufficient  to  note  that  Mrs  Clayton  is  not  a 
beneficiary of any of them. 
Financial significance of issues 
[15] Overall   the   differences   between   the   positions   of   the   parties   are   stark.  
Mr Clayton considers that as none of the trust assets constitute relationship property 
Mrs Clayton is only entitled to sole ownership of the former matrimonial home and 
chattels (valued at $850,000 as at 31 March 2011) and $30,000 already paid.  On the 
other  hand,  Mrs  Clayton  considers  that,  apart  from  the  value  of  Mr  Clayton's 
separate property, which is agreed at $500,000, she is entitled to half of the value of 
the business and trust assets, which she claims constitute relationship property. 
[16] As far as the valuation of Mr Clayton's business interests are concerned, if 
his approach is upheld, his business interests will have a negative value.  If, however,   Mrs  Clayton's  approach  is  upheld,  she  will  be  entitled,  according  to  her  expert 
witness,  Mr  Brendan  Lyne,  to  the  value  of  half  of  a  property  pool  estimated  at  the 
time of the Family Court hearing at $28,831,000. 
Family Court decision 
[17] In  the  Family  Court,  in  addition  to  setting  aside  the  prenuptial  agreement, 
Judge Munro decided that: 
(a) Apart from Mr Clayton's original separate property, which the parties 
agreed was to be valued at $500,000 as at the agreed date of 31 March 
2011, the increase in value of his property over and above that figure 
was relationship property to be shared equally.5 
(b) Mrs Clayton's claim in respect of the Claymark Trust was limited to 
her  share  in  any  debt  owing  by  the  Trust  to  Mr  Clayton  or  to  any 
entities found to comprise property in his hands.6 
(c) The  VRPT  did  not  meet  the  basic  elements  of  a  trust  and  was 
therefore   illusory.      Its   property   was   property   in   the   hands   of 
Mr Clayton.7 
(d) Mrs  Clayton  was  entitled  to  a  half  share  in  the  current  equity  of  the 
two educational trusts.8 
(e) A further trust, the Claymark International Trust, had no property that 
could be the subject of a claim by Mrs Clayton.9 
(f) Mrs  Clayton  was  entitled  to  a  half  share  in  the  equity  of  the  four 
post-separation trusts.10 
                                                 5  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [36]â€“[66]. 6  At [68]â€“[71]. 7  At [72]â€“[85]. 8  At [87]â€“[93]. 9  At [95]â€“[96]. 10  At [97]â€“[113].   (g) In  determining  the  fair  market  value  of  Mr  Clayton's  business 
interests as at 31 March 2011 by the agreed capitalisation of earnings 
methodology,  the  figure  for  EBITDA  (earnings  before  interest,  tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) should be $6,750,000 and the multiple 
should be 6.25.11 
(h) The  value  of  the  former  family  home  at  Banksia  Place,  which  had 
already been transferred to Mrs Clayton, should be $850,000.12 
[18] Mr  Clayton  and  the  other  trustees  of  the  various  trusts  appealed  to  the 
High Court  against  the  decisions  of  Judge  Munro  referred  to  in  (a),  (c)â€“(d)  and 
(f)â€“(h).      Mrs   Clayton   cross-appealed   against   the   decision   referred   to   in   (b).  
Mrs Clayton did not cross-appeal against the decision referred to in (e). 
High Court decision 
[19] In the High Court Rodney Hansen J decided that: 
(a) As  the  evidence  relating  to  the  valuation  of  the  former  family  home 
was  unsatisfactory,  the  issue  was  to  be  remitted  to  the  Family  Court 
for rehearing.13 
(b) The post-marriage increase in value of Mr Clayton's separate property 
was relationship property and should be shared equally.14 
(c) The valuation issues relating to Mr Clayton's business interests (the 
EBITDA  and  the  multiple)  were  correctly  determined  by  the  Family 
Court Judge.15 
(d) For reasons that differed from those that found favour with the Family 
Court   Judge,   the   VRPT   was   not   a   sham,   but   it   was   illusory.  
                                                 11  At [114]â€“[134]. 12  At [135]â€“[137]. 13  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [15]â€“[22]. 14  At [23]â€“[44]. 15  At [45]â€“[64].   Mr Clayton  retained  powers  tantamount  to  ownership  of  the  trust 
property.16 
(e) The  Family  Court  Judge  was  right  to  decide  that  Mrs  Clayton  was 
entitled  to  a  half  share  in  the current  equity  of  the  two  educational 
trusts.17 
(f) The  appeal  should  be  allowed  in  respect  of  the  Denarau  Resort, 
Chelmsford  and  Lighter  Quay  5B Trusts  and  the issues  referred  back 
to  the  Family  Court  for  further  evidence  to  be  adduced  and  the 
question of remedy reconsidered.18 
(g) The Family Court Judge's finding in respect of the Sophia No 7 Trust 
was upheld, but the issue of remedy was remitted to the Family Court 
for reconsideration.19 
(h) Mrs Clayton's cross-appeal in relation to the Claymark Trust failed.20 
[20] Mr Clayton and the other trustees of the various  trusts have  appealed to this 
Court  in  respect  of  the  questions  arising  from  the  decisions  of  Rodney  Hansen  J 
referred to in (c)â€“(e) and (g).  Mrs Clayton has appealed in respect of the questions 
arising from the decisions referred to in (f) and (h). 
[21] We now address each of the nine questions. 
The Vaughan Road Property Trust (VRPT) 
The 1999 settlement of the VRPT 
[22] The settlement of the VRPT is conveniently described by Judge Munro in the 
Family Court: 
                                                 16  At [68]â€“[91]. 17  At [93]â€“[102]. 18  At [103]â€“[110] and [118]â€“[128]. 19  At [111]â€“[117]. 20  At [129]â€“[149].   [72] This  trust was  settled  on  14  June  1999  by  way  of  a  declaration  of 
trust  by  Mark  Clayton  as  trustee.    Effectively,  he  is  the  settlor  and  sole 
trustee.  The discretionary beneficiaries include Mr Clayton as the principal 
family  member,  Mrs  Clayton  as  his  wife,  and  the children  are  the  final 
beneficiaries. [23] The   operation   of   the   VRPT   during   the   marriage   is   also   conveniently 
described by Judge Munro: [74] The Vaughan  Road  Property Trust  acted  as a  banker.   It  has  largely 
borrowed from BNZ to advance loans to other entities.  Financial statements 
have  been  prepared  on  an  annual  basis.    On  behalf  of  Mrs  Clayton,  it  is 
argued  that  this  trust  is  a  sham  largely  as  a  result  of  the  degree  of  control 
which  Mr Clayton  exercises  over  this  trust  in  that  it  could  be  said  that  the 
trust is Mr Clayton's alter-ego. [24] The VRPT's  yearly  financial  reports  show  that  as  at  31  March  2011  the 
VRPT  had  current  assets  (principally  loans  to  the  other  trusts,  including  the 
Chelmsford  and  Lighter  Quay  5B  Trusts,  and  a  current  account  for  Mr Clayton)  of 
$5,538,444  and  current  liabilities  (including  loans  from  the  Claymark  Trust  and 
Claymark   Finance   Ltd)   of   $6,240,375.      Overall   the   net   asset   position   was 
$4,506,152.  
The trust deed 
[25] For present purposes the relevant provisions of the trust deed are: INTRODUCTION 
... 
B. The Trustees hold the sum of ten dollars upon the terms and with and 
subject to the powers and discretions set out in this deed.

11. TRUSTEES' DISCRETION UNFETTERED 
11.1 For  the  avoidance  of  doubt  and  notwithstanding  anything  in this

act   impartially   towards   Beneficiaries,   the   Trustees   shall   have 
unfettered discretion as to the exercise of the powers and discretions 
conferred upon them by this deed even though: 
(a) the  interests  of  all  Beneficiaries  are  not  considered  by  the 
Trustees; 
(b) the  exercise  would  or  might  be  contrary  to  the  interests  of 
any present or future Beneficiary; 
(c) the  exercise  results,  at  any  time  whether  before  or  on  the 
Vesting  Day,  in  the  whole  or  in  any  part  of  the  capital  or

or  to  any  two  or  more  Beneficiaries  in  equal  or  unequal 
proportions,  in  either  case  to  the  exclusion  of  the  other 
Beneficiaries. 
12. POWERS AND DISCRETIONS OF TRUSTEES 
12.1 Powers: To achieve the objects of the Trust, the Trustees shall have 
in the administration, management and investment of the Trust Fund 
all the rights, powers and privileges of a natural person and, subject 
always  to  the  trusts  imposed  by this  deed,  may  deal  with  the  Trust 
Fund as if the Trustees were the absolute owners of and beneficially 
entitled  to  the  Trust  Fund  and,  accordingly,  in  addition  to  any 
specific  powers  vested  in  the  Trustees  by  law,  in  dealing  with  the 
Trust  Fund  or  acting as  Trustees  of  the  Trust,  the  Trustees  may  do 
any act or thing or procure the doing of any act or thing or enter into 
any  obligation  whatever,  including,  without  limitation,  exercising 
unrestricted   powers   to   borrow   and   raise   money,   and   to   give 
mortgages, other securities, guarantees and indemnities. 
12.2 Discretions:  Except  as otherwise  expressly  provided  by  this  deed, 
the  Trustees  may  exercise  all  the  powers  and  discretions  vested  in 
the Trustees by this deed in the absolute and uncontrolled discretion 
of the Trustees at such time or times, upon such terms and conditions 
and in such manner as the Trustees may decide. 
12.3 Appropriated funds:  The  powers  and  discretions  vested  in  the 
Trustees  by  law  or  by  this  deed  may  be  exercised  by  the  Trustees 
both in respect of the Trust Fund and, in respect of any property held   by  the  Trustees  but  appropriated,  credited  on  account  or  otherwise 
held for any Beneficiary, contingently or otherwise. 
12.4 Investment discretion: In exercising their powers of investment the 
Trustees  may  acquire  any  property,  or  retain  or  deal  with  any 
property which from time to time comprises the whole or part of the 
Trust Fund notwithstanding that any act or omission by the Trustees 
in  the  exercise  of  those  powers  and  discretions  would  be, or  could 
be, contrary to the principles governing the investment of trust funds 
set out in the Trustee Act 1956.  This clause expresses a "contrary 
intention" for the purposes of section 13D of that Act. 
12.5 Unanimous  approval:  Where  there  is  more  than  one  Trustee  in 
office, except as provided in this deed, all powers and discretions of 
the  Trustees  shall  be  exercised  with  the  unanimous  approval  of  the 
Trustees.

... 
19. TRUSTEE'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
19.1 Negation of conflict:  A Trustee may act as such and exercise all of 
that Trustee's powers and discretions notwithstanding that: 
(a) that Trustee  is  associated  as  a  director, or  otherwise  in  a 
private  capacity, or  as  trustee  of  any  other  trust, with  any 
company or other person to which the Trustees sell or lease 
any property forming part of the Trust Fund, or in which the 
Trustees  hold  or  propose  to  acquire  shares,  securities  or 
other  rights  as  part  of  the Trust Fund, or  with  which  the 
Trustees otherwise deal as Trustees of the Trust; or 
(b) that Trustee  may  be  a  trustee  of  any  other  trust  to  or  from 
which  the Trustees  propose  to  sell  or  purchase  shares, 
securities  or  other  rights  or  property  or  with  which  the 
Trustees otherwise deal as Trustees of the Trust; or 
(c) the  interests  or  duty  of  that Trustee in  any  particular matter 
may conflict with the duty of that Trustee to the Trust Fund 
or any Beneficiary; or   (d) such Trustee is personally purchasing or taking on lease any 
property forming  part  of  the Trust Fund, or  personally 
selling any property to become  part of the Trust Fund, or is 
otherwise dealing with the Trust Fund in a personal capacity 
as well as that of a Trustee. 
... 
23. AMENDMENT OF TRUST DEED 
23.1 The  Trustees  may,  with  the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Principal 
Family Member while the Principal Family Member is living, at any 
time  or  times  during  the Trust  Period,  and  without  infringing  the 
rules  against  perpetuities,  vary,  revoke  or  enlarge  all  or  any  of  the 
provisions    of    this    deed    concerning    the    management    or 
administration of the Trust. The Family Court findings 
[26] In  the  Family  Court  Judge  Munro found that the VRPT was "illusory" and 
that  consequently  its  property  was  property  in  the  hands  of  Mr  Clayton  personally, 
any debts owing to it were debts owing to Mr Clayton and any current account that 
the  VRPT  had  with  any  other  entity  was  effectively  a current  account  owned  by 
Mr Clayton.21  The Judge's reasons for these findings were: 
(a) The  provisions  of  cl  11  taken  in  conjunction  with  cl 19.1(c)  of  the 
VRPT  deed  negated  the  beneficiaries'  ability  to  call  the  trustee  to 
account  in  the  exercise  of  his  discretion.   The  beneficiaries  therefore 
had no rights under the deed enforceable against the trustee.22 
(b) Unlike  an  administrative  power  to  appoint  and  remove  trustees,  the 
power of revocation in cl 23 of the trust deed was a dispositive power 
which  could  be  exercised  selfishly  without  regard  to  the  interests  of 
others.23 
(c) The  form  of  the  VRPT  deed  and  the  manner  in  which  it  had  been 
administered indicated that it is a convenient structure for commercial 
                                                 21  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [85]. 22  At [78]. 23  At [82] relying on the advice of the Privy Council in Tasarruf Mevduati Sigorta Fonu v Merrill 
Lynch Bank and Trust Co (Cayman) Ltd [2011] UKPC 17, [2012] 1 WLR 1721 [TMSF].    purposes, carrying few hallmarks of a trust.24 
[27] In respect of the third reason, the Judge said: [84] Although  Mr  Clayton  is  the  sole  trustee,  the  evidence  is  consistent 
that  he  in  fact  does  not  make  decisions  regarding  the  administration  of  the 
trust, rather those decisions are made by Mr Cheshire and Mr [Warden] and 
are made on a purely commercial basis.  In evidence, Mr Cheshire displayed 
little  understanding  of  the  obligations  of  a  trustee  to  have  regard  to  the 
interests  of  beneficiaries  of  the  trust.    It  was  his  evidence  that  he  and 
Mr [Warden] made decisions and simply placed necessary documentation in 
front  of  Mr  Clayton  to  sign.    Mr  Clayton  professed  to  have  very  little 
knowledge of what was contained in any of the documents he was asked to 
sign.  Additionally, Mr Clayton has the role of settlor, sole trustee, principal 
family member and discretionary beneficiary.  He also, in addition to having 
the power to revoke the trust, has the power to appoint and remove trustees 
and to appoint and remove beneficiaries. The High Court findings 
[28] In  the  High  Court  Rodney  Hansen  J  rejected  the  argument  for  Mrs  Clayton 
that the VRPT was a sham.25  He accepted that it was clear Mr Clayton intended to 
create  a  trust  and  intended  to  do  so  for  legitimate  business  purposes.    The  Judge 
identified the issue as being whether the trust was "illusory" in the sense that, in light 
of the provisions of the trust deed, Mr Clayton retained such control that the proper 
construction was that he did not intend to give or part with control over the property 
sufficient to constitute a trust. 
[29] The Judge did not agree with the Family Court Judge's reasons for finding 
that the VRPT was "illusory".  He did not accept that cls 11 and 19.1(c) eroded the 
core obligations.26  The Judge considered that these clauses did not excuse the trustee 
from  acting  honestly  and  in  good  faith.    They  merely  relieved  him  from  the 
obligation to act impartially towards beneficiaries.27 
[30] Nor  did  the  Judge  accept  that  the  power  of  revocation  in  cl  23  conferred  on 
the  trustee  rights  tantamount  to  ownership.    The  Judge  considered  it  could  not  be 
                                                 24  At [83]. 25  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [79]. 26  At [81]. 27  At [81]â€“[82].   regarded in any sense as a fiduciary power.28  The Judge found the power in this case 
was much more limited than the power in Tasarruf Mevduati Sigorta Fonu v Merrill 
Lynch Bank and Trust Co (Cayman) Ltd (TMSF).29  He said the power in cl 23:30 ... is directed only to the provisions of the trust deed which concern the 
management or administration of the trust.  It does not confer in the trustee 
any power to deal with trust property as he pleases. [31] Instead Rodney Hansen J upheld the Family Court Judge's decision that the 
VRPT  was  illusory  on  the  basis  that  cls  4.1,  6.1, 12  and  14.1  led  irresistibly  to  the 
conclusion that Mr Clayton indeed retained powers tantamount to ownership of trust 
property.31  The  Judge  was  particularly  influenced  by  comparison  with  the  decision 
of Winkelmann J in the High Court in Financial Markets Authority v Hotchin where 
Winkelmann J  upheld  a  trust  over  which  Mr  Hotchin  had  extensive  powers  as  not 
illusory.  This finding was principally on the basis of the existence of a clause in the 
trust  deed  which  prevented  self-dealing,  a  clause  with  no  equivalent  in  the  present 
case.32  Rodney Hansen J said: [89] Many of the provisions of the trust are identical to or not materially 
different from those in Hotchin where  Mr Hotchin, though neither a  trustee 
or   beneficiary,   had   the   power   to   appoint   himself   sole trustee   and   a 
beneficiary.   As  in  the  case  of  the  Vaughan  Road  Property Trust,  the  deeds 
conferred  unfettered  discretion  upon  the  trustees  to  distribute  the  property 
without   considering   the   interests   of   any   beneficiary,   including   future 
beneficiaries.    However,  the  trust  deeds  in Hotchin contained  a  prohibition 
on self-dealing.  Whereas cl 14.1 of the deed in this case expressly permits a 
trustee who is also a beneficiary to exercise any power or discretion in his or 
her  own  favour,  Mr  Hotchin  could  not  use  control  as  a  trustee  to  distribute 
trust  property  to  himself.    The  provision  on  self-dealing  was  critical  to 
Winkelmann J's conclusion that a claim that the trusts were illusory had no 
prospect of success. 
[90] In contrast, the provisions of the Vaughan Road Property Trust give 
Mr Clayton unfettered  power to distribute  the  income  and  the capital of the 
trust to  himself if  he  wishes  and  to bring  the  trust  to an  end  at  any  time  he 
pleases.  Mr Clayton effectively retained all the powers of ownership.  What 
he has in fact done is neither here nor there, although it appears that, through 
his  delegates,  Mr Clayton  exercises,  in  a  practical  sense,  the  powers  of 
ownership.  It is what he has the legal power to do that is important and that 
is  basically  to  do  whatever  he  wants  with  trust  property.    Within  a  largely                                                  28  At [84]. 29  TMSF, above n 23. 30  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [84]. 31  At [85]â€“[88]. 32  Financial  Markets Authority  v  Hotchin [2012]  NZHC  323, aff'd KA  No  4  Trustee Ltd v 
Financial Markets Authority [2012] NZCA 370.   conventional framework the trust deed provides an appearance of separation.  
The reality is, however, that if he chooses to, Mr Clayton is able to deal with 
trust property just as he would if the trust had never been created. The appeal and cross-appeal 
[32] Mr  Clayton,  in  his  capacity  as  the  trustee  of  the  VRPT,  appeals  against  the 
finding  of  the  High  Court  that  the  VRPT  was  illusory.    For  Mr  Clayton  as  trustee, 
Mr Carruthers QC submits that the Judge erred because: 
(a) There  is  no  distinction  between  a  "sham"  and  an  "illusory"  trust.  
Once it was accepted that the VRPT was not a "sham" there was no 
basis  for  finding  it  was  "illusory".    There  is  "no  halfway  house" 
between a sham and a genuine trust. 
(b) Mr Clayton's roles as sole trustee, the principal family member and a 
discretionary  beneficiary,  and  his  powers  to  appoint  and  remove 
trustees  and  to  exercise  a  power  of  appointment  in  his  own  favour, 
were  normal  incidents  of  discretionary  trusts  in  New  Zealand  and 
elsewhere. 
(c) His roles and powers did not mean in law that the "control" he held 
over   trust   property   created   personal   property.      He   was   fully 
accountable  for  his  trusteeship  under  the  terms  of  the  discretionary 
trust  which  were  always  enforceable  against  him  by any  disaffected 
discretionary object, including Mrs Clayton. 
[33] In addition to opposing Mr Clayton's appeal on the grounds that the Courts 
below  were  right  to  find  the VRPT  was  illusory,  Mrs  Clayton  cross-appeals  against 
the  High  Court  finding  that  the  VRPT  was  not  a  sham.    For  Mrs  Clayton, 
Lady Chambers  QC  submits  that  at  inception  Mr  Clayton  did  not  intend  to  create  a 
genuine trust as evidenced by: 
(a) His  total  and  excessive  control  under  the  trust  deed.    Properly 
interpreted  the  arrangements  were,  and  were  intended  to  be,  a  legal 
structure to hold the property for Mr Clayton.   (b) Poor   trust   administration   and   documentation;   the   evidence   of 
transactions subsequent to the settlement of the trust and Mr Clayton's 
subsequent conduct. 
[34] Lady Chambers also submits that a broader approach should be taken to sham 
trusts in the context of a relationship breakdown.  On the facts and evidence of this 
case the ownership of the assets remained with Mr Clayton at all times cloaked by a 
trust deed which in substance left him as the owner of the property and consequently 
free to deal with it in any way he pleased.   
Further submissions 
[35] In the course of the hearing of the appeal, we raised with counsel two further 
questions not addressed in the judgments under appeal or in the written submissions 
for the parties on appeal, namely: 
(a) whether Mr Clayton's general power of appointment under cl 7.1 of 
the  VRPT  itself  constituted  relationship  property  under  the  Property 
(Relationships) Act 1976 (PRA);33 and  
(b) whether, in the event we found the VRPT was not a sham or illusory, 
Mrs Clayton might be entitled to a compensation order under s 44C of 
the  PRA  in  relation  to  dispositions  of  relationship  property  made  to 
the VRPT. 
[36] We  raised  the  first  question  because  under  cl  7.1  Mr  Clayton  has  power  to 
appoint himself as the sole discretionary beneficiary of the VRPT thereby becoming 
the  sole  beneficiary  of  the  trust.34  In  light  of  the  decision  of  the  Privy  Council  in 
TMSF it  was  open  to  argument  that  a  power of  this  nature  was  "tantamount  to 
ownership" of the property of the trust.35 Then,  when  the  extended  definition  of 
"property" in s 2 of the PRA, which includes "any other right or interest", is taken 
                                                 33  This  question  was  mentioned  in  passing  in  the  Family  Court  judgment,  above  n 1,  at  [74],  but 
not considered further. 34  By virtue of cls 4.1, 6.1 and 10.1(a).   35  TMSF, above n 23, at [42]â€“[44] and [59]â€“[60].   into account, it was open to argument that Mr Clayton's right to exercise the general 
power of appointment under cl 7.1 was "relationship property" under s 8 of the PRA. 
[37] We received submissions on this question from counsel during the hearing. 
[38] Mr Carruthers submitted that the power of appointment under cl 7.1 would be 
constrained by Mr Clayton's fiduciary obligations which would apply by virtue of 
the doctrine of "fraud on a power".  He referred in this context to the Kain v Hutton 
litigation.36 
[39] Lady  Chambers  rejected  Mr  Carruthers' submission that Mr Clayton would 
be constrained by the doctrine of "fraud on a power" if he exercised the power under 
cl 7.1 of the VRPT in his own favour.  She referred to the decisions of Wong v Burt 
and TMSF.37 
[40] In reply Mr Carruthers submitted that the decisions in Wong v Burt and Kain 
v  Hutton supported  the  view  that  there  could  be  a  proper  and  improper  use  of  a 
power.38  If  the  donee  exercised  the  power  with  an  improper  intention,  the  court 
would exercise its supervisory jurisdiction in equity and intervene. 
[41] As we did not receive full submissions from the parties during the hearing on 
the   second   question   we   had   raised,   we   sought   and   obtained   further   written 
submissions from them following the hearing. 
[42] Lady Chambers submits that Mrs Clayton is entitled to a compensation order 
under s 44C because: 
(a) The accounts for the VRPT show that from 2000 until 2006, the year 
of  separation,  Mr  Clayton  made  substantial interest  free  on  demand 
advances to the VRPT (in 2005 the balance was $3,099,637, dropping 
to $1,682,137 in 2006). 
                                                 36  Kain  v  Hutton [2007]  NZCA  199,  [2007]  3  NZLR  349  [Kain  v  Hutton (CA)]; Kain  v  Hutton 
[2008] NZSC 61, [2008] 3 NZLR 589 [Kain v Hutton (SC)]. 37  Wong v Burt [2005] 1 NZLR 91 (CA). 38  Wong  v  Burt,  above  n 37,  at  [27]â€“[32];  and Kain  v  Hutton (SC),  above  n 36,  at  [46]â€“[47]  per 
Tipping J.   (b) In  the  absence  of  any  contrary  evidence  from  Mr  Clayton,  the  Court 
must infer that these funds were derived from the Claymark business 
that  Mr  Clayton  operated  throughout  the  marriage.    They  were 
therefore relationship property. 
(c) As  interest  free  on  demand  advances,  they  were  dispositions  of 
relationship property. 
[43] Mr  Carruthers  opposes  the  Court  considering  the  s  44C  question  because  it 
was not argued in the Courts below and was not the subject of the grant of leave by 
this  Court.    He  also submits  that  evidence  is  necessary  to  explain  the  financial 
arrangements  involving  the  funds  in  the VRPT.   The  evidence  would  show  that  the 
money was to finance the businesses and was not available to Mr Clayton personally 
so as to constitute relationship property. 
[44] In  reply,  Lady  Chambers  has  taken  issue  with  aspects  of  Mr  Carruthers' 
submissions.  She accepts that issues of quantification will need to be the subject of 
further  evidence  in  the  High  Court,  but  that  does  not  affect  the  question  of  the 
application of s 44C. 
Analysis 
[45] The starting point is to note the following features of the VRPT: 
(a) It was established by way of a formal deed of trust. 
(b) Mr Clayton was the settlor, the sole trustee, and the "Principal Family 
Member". 
(c) The original trust fund was $10. 
(d) The  beneficiaries  were  "Discretionary  Beneficiaries"  and  "Final 
Beneficiaries".  The "Discretionary Beneficiaries" were Mr Clayton 
as the "Principal Family Member", his children who were also the 
"Final  Beneficiaries", their issue, Mrs Clayton,  any trust including   any  beneficiary,  and  any  person  appointed  by  Mr  Clayton  under 
cl 7.1(a). 
(e) In his capacity as the sole trustee, Mr Clayton had power to: 
(i) distribute the income and capital of the trust to himself as one 
of the discretionary beneficiaries: cls 4.1, 6.1 and 10.1(a); 
(ii) make  such  distributions  to  himself  without  considering  the 
interests  of  the  other  beneficiaries  and  notwithstanding  any 
duty to act impartially towards beneficiaries: cls 11.1, 12.2 and 
14.1; 
(iii) subject to the terms of the trust, to deal with the trust fund as if 
he  was  the  absolute  owner  of  it  and  beneficially  entitled  to  it: 
cl 12.1; 
(iv) exercise  all  the  trustee's  powers  and  discretions 
notwithstanding any conflict of interest: cl 19.1; and 
(v) revoke  any  of  the  provisions  of  the  deed  concerning  the 
management or administration of the trust: cl 23.1. 
(f) In his capacity as the "Principal Family Member", Mr Clayton had 
power to: 
(i) appoint  and  remove  any  of  the  discretionary  beneficiaries: 
cl 7.1; and 
(ii) appoint and remove trustees: cl 17.1. 
[46] We  note  that  there  is  nothing  untoward  in  Mr  Clayton  being  the  settlor,  the 
trustee and one of the discretionary beneficiaries of the VRPT.  It is well-established 
that: 
    (a) a   person   may   be   both   the   settlor   and   trustee   of   a   trust.39  A 
settlor-trustee will be subject to the same equitable obligations as any 
trustee;40 and 
(b) a person may be both a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust.41  There is 
no  requirement  in  trustee  law  that  all  trusts  must  have  independent 
trustees who are not beneficiaries. 
[47] At  the  same  time,  however,  a  trustee may  not  be  the  sole  beneficiary  of  a 
trust.    This  is  because  when  the  legal  and  equitable  (or  beneficial)  interests  in  the 
trust property reside in the same person there is no trust.42 
[48] Consequently,  were  Mr  Clayton  to  exercise  his  power  of  appointment  under 
cl  7.1  of  the  VRPT  and  he  were  to  become  the  sole  beneficiary  of  the  trust,  there 
would  be  no  trust.   We  address  the  significance  of  the  existence  of  this  power  later 
when  considering  the  submissions  relating  to  the  first  question  raised  during  the 
hearing of the appeal.43 
[49] The next point to note is that the VRPT appears to meet the well-recognised 
requirements for a valid discretionary trust.

LexisNexis) at [2.22]. 43  Below at [86]â€“[114].   [50] First, the three essential certainties for a trust existed:44 
(a) Mr  Clayton,  as  settlor,  intended  to  create  a  trust  for  legitimate 
business  purposes.45  There  are  concurrent  factual  findings  to  that 
effect in the Courts below. 46 
(b) There was trust property ($10) held by Mr Clayton in his capacity as a 
trustee. 
(c) There   were   trust   objects   able   to   be   ascertained,   namely   the 
discretionary beneficiaries.47 
[51] Second, while the deed of trust conferred wide powers on Mr Clayton in his 
capacity as sole trustee, it did not (and could not) eliminate the fiduciary obligations 
imposed on him at law in that capacity which would be enforceable, if necessary, by 
the  other  discretionary  beneficiaries.    In  other  words,  the  requirement  for  "an 
irreducible core of obligations" was met, as Millett LJ put it in Armitage v Nurse:48 ... there is an irreducible  core  of  obligations  owed  by  the  trustees  to  the 
beneficiaries  and  enforceable  by  them  which  is  fundamental  to  the  concept 
of a trust.  If the beneficiaries have no rights enforceable against the trustees 
there are no trusts. [52] The  irreducible  core  of  obligations  owed  by  a  trustee  are  the  obligations  to 
act  honestly  and  in  good  faith.49  Courts  are  most  reluctant  to  find  that  those 
obligations do not apply.50  Here, as Rodney Hansen J held in the High Court,51 the 
provisions of the VRPT deed did not erode those core obligations. 
[53] The  powers  of  Mr  Clayton  as  trustee  under  the  VRPT  to  deal  with  the  trust 
property  for  his  own  benefit  and  without  regard  to  the  interests  of  the  other

that they had no rights enforceable against him as trustee.  Mr Clayton's core duties 
as a trustee of honesty and good  faith remained  at law and were  enforceable by the 
other beneficiaries, namely the existing "Discretionary Beneficiaries" and the "Final 
Beneficiaries".52 
[54] While discretionary beneficiaries have a mere hope or expectation a trust will 
be  exercised  in  their  favour,53 it  does  not  follow  that  the  absence  of  a  proprietary 
interest  removes  all  rights  from  a  discretionary  beneficiary,  nor  all  duties  from  the 
trustee.    Discretionary  beneficiaries have  rights  enforceable  against  the  trustees  to 
ensure  that  a  trustee  properly  considers  whether  the  beneficiaries  of  a  discretionary 
trust  should  have  the  discretion  exercised  in  their  favour  and  to  compel  proper 
administration of the trust.54 
[55] We  do  not  agree  with  Rodney  Hansen  J  in  the  High  Court  that  the  specific 
powers of Mr Clayton as trustee under cls 4.1, 6.1, 12 and 14.1 of the VRPT meant 
that he retained powers tantamount to ownership of trust property.  As we have said, 
Mr Clayton in his capacity as trustee of the VRPT was obliged by general equitable 
principles  to  exercise  his  powers  honestly  and  in  good  faith  and  to  account  for  the 
trust property, such obligations being enforceable by the other beneficiaries. 
[56] The VRPT therefore met the legal requirements for a valid discretionary trust.  
There was no suggestion that Mr Clayton had in fact exercised any of his powers as 
trustee   in   breach   of   his   obligations   to   the   other   beneficiaries.      Rather 
Lady Chambers' argument was that the existence of the powers  of  control  over  the 
trust assets conferred on Mr Clayton under the VRPT meant that the trust was a sham 
or illusory.  We therefore turn to those questions.

[57] The   legal   requirements   for   a   sham   in   New   Zealand   are   conveniently 
summarised  in  the  majority  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  in Ben  Nevis  Forestry 
Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue:55 In essence, a sham is a pretence. ... A document will be a sham when it does 
not evidence the true common intention of the parties.  They either intend to 
create different rights and obligations from those evidenced by the document 
or they do not intend to create any rights or obligations, whether of the kind 
evidenced  by  the  document  or  at  all.  A  document  which  originally  records 
the true  common  intention  of  the  parties  may  become  a  sham  if  the  parties 
later  agree  to  change  their  arrangement  but  leave  the  original  document 
standing  and  continue  to  represent  it  as  an  accurate  reflection  of  their 
arrangement. [58] The majority also pointed out that:56 An  allegation  of  sham,  being  akin  to  an  allegation  of  fraud,  should  not  be 
lightly  made.  Those  engaging  in  a  sham  are  in  reality  seeking  to  deceive 
others  as  to  the  true  nature  of  what  they  have  agreed  and  are  intending  to 
achieve. [59] This  approach to  the  concept  of  sham  reflected  authorities  in  England,  this 
Court and Australia.57 
[60] In Ben Nevis the majority  held that the High Court and Court of Appeal had 
correctly applied the law relating to shams and agreed with their concurrent findings 
that the particular transaction at issue was not a sham.58 
[61] To  determine  whether  a  particular  transaction  constitutes  a  sham,  the  court 
will focus on the actual intentions of the parties to the transaction and compare them 
with the acts done or documents created.  In doing so, the court will not be restricted 
to the legal form of the transaction, but will examine its substance in light of all the 
                                                 55  Ben  Nevis  Forestry  Ventures  Ltd  v  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue [2008]  NZSC  115, [2009]

the  transaction  was  intended  to  be  genuine,  the  focus  will  be  on  the  actions  and 
words of the parties, both contemporary and subsequent. 
[62] This approach reflects equity's preference for substance over form and the 
conceptual basis of the sham doctrine which "lies in the court's ability to see through 
acts or documents" intended to disguise or conceal the truth of the matter.60 
[63] There is no dispute that the sham doctrine applies in the context of trusts.61  If 
evidence establishes that, notwithstanding the existence of a document described as a 
deed of trust, the parties to the deed (the settlor and the trustee(s)) had no intention of 
creating a trust, there will be no trust.62  In this event any property the subject of the 
"trust" will be regarded as still belonging to the "settlor".  Where legal title to  the 
property has been transferred to a purported trustee who is not the settlor, the trustee 
holds  the  property  on  resulting  trust  for  the  settlor,  in  whom  the  beneficial  interest 
remains.63  The property will be available to third party claimants against the settlor.

doctrine, including:

(b) whether, as a matter of law, proof of a sham requires establishment of 
some  kind  of  specific  shamming  intention,  or  whether  what  is  being 
proved is really just a lack of certainty of intention on the part of the 
settlor, meaning nothing more is needed.65 
[65] It  is  unnecessary  for  us  in  this  case  to  express  a  view  on  the  first  of  these 
questions because, as Mr Clayton is both the settlor and sole trustee of the VRPT, the 
focus is solely on his intentions in respect of the creation of the VRPT. 
[66] In  respect  of  the  second  question,  we  adopt  the  approach  of  this  Court  in 
Official  Assignee  v  Wilson where  it  was  indicated  that  a  subjectively  assessed 
shamming intention is required.66  As Glazebrook J pointed out:67 ...  where  a  sham  is  alleged,  the  search  is  for  subjective  intent  that  the 
transaction  is  a  sham.    After  all,  the  whole  point  of  a  sham  is  that  it  is 
intended  to  have  an  effect  other  than  the  effect  it  would  have  if  looked  at 
objectively. [67] Applying  this  approach  here,  we  agree  with  the  concurrent  findings  in  the 
Courts  below  that Mr  Clayton  genuinely  intended  to  create  a  trust  when  he 
established the VRPT.  In the Family Court, Judge Munro found that the trust was set 
up to separate and distance the underlying land ownership from the operating assets 
of  his  company,  Claymark  Industries  Ltd.68  In  the  High  Court,  Rodney  Hansen  J 
found that it was clear that Mr Clayton intended to create a trust and intended to do 
so "for legitimate business purposes".69

intended  the  deed  of  trust  for  the VRPT  not  to  create  any  rights  or  obligations  of  a 
trust nature.  Nor was there any suggestion that Mr Clayton was seeking to deceive 
anyone as to the nature of the trust.  He was not cross-examined on this basis. 
[69] We  therefore  do  not accept Lady Chambers' submissions that the provisions 
of the trust deed or the subsequent administration of the trust establish the requisite 
intention  on  the  part  of  Mr  Clayton  to  create  a  sham  rather  than  a  genuine  trust.  
There would need to have been strong  evidence  at trial undermining the  concurrent 
findings  in  the  Courts  below  before  an  appellate  court  would  find  an  allegation  of 
sham involving pretence and deceit established. 
[70] Accordingly we uphold the High Court Judge's finding that the VRPT was 
not a sham. 
An illusory trust? 
[71] We understand that this is the first New Zealand case where the concept of an 
"illusory trust", as distinct from a "sham trust", has been considered. 
[72] In the Family Court, Judge Munro decided that the VRPT was "illusory" 
because  Mr  Clayton  had  total  control  over  the  trust  without  the  need  to  account  to 
the beneficiaries and could revoke the trust in his favour at any time.70 
[73] In the High Court, Rodney Hansen J decided that the VRPT was "illusory" 
for different reasons, namely because Mr Clayton had unfettered power to distribute 
the income and capital of the trust to himself if he wished and to bring the trust to an 
end  at  any  time  he  pleased.71   Rodney  Hansen  J  considered  that  Mr  Clayton 
"effectively retained all the powers of ownership" and in "reality" was able to deal 
with the trust property "just as he would if the trust had never been created".72 
                                                 70  At [85]. 71  At [90]. 72  At [90].   [74] Neither  Judge  referred  to  any  authority  for  the  proposition  that  an  otherwise 
genuine trust, which has not been found to be a sham, might be declared not to exist 
because its terms somehow made it "illusory".  Rodney Hansen J considered that the 
two  concepts  (sham  and  illusory) were  "quite  different"  and  the  distinction  was 
"important".73  In his view the VRPT would be "illusory" if:74 ... in  light  of  the  provisions  of  the  trust  deed,  Mr Clayton  retains  such 
control that  the  proper  construction is  that  he  did  not  intend  to  give  or  part 
with control over the property sufficient to constitute a trust. [75] In  our  view,  however,  there  are  several  significant  difficulties  with  this 
approach to the adoption of a concept of an "illusory" trust in New Zealand in this 
case. 
[76] First, it is inconsistent with the findings that: 
(a) the VRPT was not a sham because Mr Clayton genuinely intended to 
create  a  valid  trust  and  therefore  did  intend  to  part  with  control  over 
the trust property; 
(b) the VRPT did not erode Mr Clayton's core obligations as trustee to act 
honestly and in good faith; and 
(c) the other beneficiaries would be able to enforce those core obligations 
should Mr Clayton act in his capacity as trustee in breach of them. 
[77] Second, the suggestion of a distinction between a sham and an "illusory" trust 
is  not  supportable.    Not  only  are  the  terms  effectively  synonymous  but  their  legal 
definitions  overlap,  with  definitions of "illusory trust" referring to an arrangement 
which looks like or appears to be a trust but has no real substance or effect so that no 
trust was intended.75 
                                                 73  At [78]. 74  At [79]. 75  Bryan A  Garner  (ed) Black's  Law  Dictionary (10th  ed, Thomson  Reuters,  St  Paul  (Minnesota), 
2014)  at  1744;  Daniel  Greenberg  (ed) Jowitt's  Dictionary  of  English  Law (3rd ed,  Sweet  & 
Maxwell, London, 2010) vol 1 at 1132; and Kelly and Kelly, above n 60, at [4.37].   [78] Both terms focus on the real or true intentions of the settlor.  The question in 
both cases is, notwithstanding the existence of a trust deed, did the settlor genuinely 
intend  to  create  a  valid,  enforceable  trust.    In  the  absence  of  the  requisite  genuine 
intention,  there  will  be  no  trust  at  all.    As  we  have  already  noted,  this  question 
involves an examination of all the relevant evidence relating to the determination of 
the settlor's real or true intentions.  The inquiry focuses not on the legal form of the 
otherwise valid trust deed but on those intentions. 
[79] The  absence  of  any  real  distinction  between  the  terms  is  reinforced  by  their 
use in other jurisdictions: 
(a) In  the  United  States  the  term  "illusory  trust"  is  used  instead  of 
"sham".76 
(b) In Canada Waters' Law of Trusts in Canada explains "illusory trusts" 
under the heading of "sham trust".77  Lady  Chambers  placed  some 
reliance on the Waters' text, but it is apparent from it that, like a sham, 
the  concern  is  with  the  intention  of  the  settlor  to  employ  the  trust 
concept to perpetuate an illegality. 
(c) In Australia Jacobs'  Law  of  Trusts  in  Australia describes an  illusory 
trust  as  one  where  there  is  no  trust  at  all  because  there  was  no 
intention to create one.78 
[80] Third, once a court accepts, after an examination of all the relevant evidence 
relating to the settlor's intentions, that a valid trust has been established and is not a 
sham,  the  trust  should  not  be  able  to  be  treated  as  non-existent  because  the  trustee 
has  wide  powers  of  control  over  the  trust  property.    Such  an  approach  undermines 
the court's acceptance of the existence of a valid trust and overlooks the trustee's

Butterworths, Chatswood (NSW), 2006) at [510].   irreducible core obligations and the rights of beneficiaries to have them enforced by 
the court.  We agree with criticism of High Court decisions suggesting otherwise.79 
[81] Our recognition in this context of the rights of beneficiaries is consistent with 
the  approach  of  O'Regan  and  Robertson  JJ  in  this  Court  in Official  Assignee  v 
Wilson to  the  analogous  situation  in  the  context  of  an  alter  ego  trust  where  they 
said:80 [70] Actual  control  alone  does  not  provide  justification  for  looking 
through/invalidating a trust. The uptake of control by someone other than an 
authorised  person  cannot  be  sufficient  to  extinguish  the  rights  of  the 
beneficiaries under a trust. It is difficult to see the alter ego trust operating in 
New Zealand as an independent cause of action. [82] The  other  member  of  the  Court,  Glazebrook  J,  agreed  that  the  trust  itself 
could  not  be  looked  through  and  that  the  trust  assets  would  not  be  available  for 
division under the PRA.81  But she expressly left open the question whether the trust 
property might nevertheless be treated as the property of the individual involved for 
the  purposes  of  a  relationship  property  division.82  This  question  arises  now  in  the 
context of our consideration of Mr Clayton's power of appointment under cl 7.1 of 
the VRPT deed.83 
[83] This Court's reluctance to invalidate trusts on grounds other than proof of a 
sham   reflects   a   concern   that   a   decision   doing   so   might   have   unintended 
consequences  for  other  valid  trusts  in  New  Zealand,  including  other  discretionary 
trusts.    The  Court  does  not  have  access  to  information  relating  to  the  generally 
accepted terms of such trusts.  Consideration of reform of the law in this area, if it is 
required, should be left to the Law Commission and Parliament. 
[84] Finally, once it is accepted that there is no real difference between the terms 
"sham" and "illusory" and there is a finding that the trust was not a sham, then, as 
Mr Carruthers submitted, there is no "halfway house" between the valid trust and a 
                                                 79  Palmer,  above  n 52,  at  480â€“486;  Palmer  "Dealing  with  the  Emerging  Popularity  of  Sham 
Trusts", above n 64, at 90â€“92. 80  Official Assignee v Wilson, above n 45. 81  At [129]. 82  At [128]â€“[129]. 83  Below at [86]â€“[114].   sham.84  Or,  as  pointed  out  in Lewin  on  Trusts, there is no "third state of affairs" 
between a valid trust and a sham.85 
[85] For  these  reasons,  we  therefore  do  not  agree  with  the  Judges  in  the  Courts 
below  that  a  trust  which  is  not  a  sham  and  is  therefore  valid  may  somehow  be 
"illusory".  There is either a valid trust or there is not.  There is no separate principle 
justifying the setting aside of a valid trust on the ground that it is "illusory".  In the 
absence  of  a  finding  of  a  sham  or  the  existence  of  a  statutory  power  to  set  aside  a 
trust (as in the case of a tax avoidance arrangement),86 the court has no power to do 
so.  In particular, there is no such power under the PRA.87  The court does have other 
powers  under  ss 44  and  44C  of  the  PRA  that  may  be  exercised  in  the  context  of 
dispositions  to  trusts,  but these  powers  do  not  enable  the  court  to  set  aside  the 
creation  of  the  trust  itself.    As  the  Supreme  Court  has  pointed  out,  subject  to  the 
relatively  limited  nature  of  the  court's  powers  under ss  44  and  44C,  Parliament 
appears to have accepted that trusts will normally prevail over relationship property 
rights.88  The  Law  Commission  has  not  yet  recommended  any  change  to  this 
approach.89 
Mr Clayton's power of appointment 
[86] As we have noted, we received submissions during the hearing of the appeal 
on  the  question of the nature and effect of Mr Clayton's power under cl 7.1 of the 
VRPT  to  appoint  himself  as  the  sole  beneficiary  of  the  trust.90  This  power  is 
conferred  on  Mr Clayton  not  in  his  capacity  as  trustee  of  the  VRPT  but  in  his 
separate capacity as the "Principal Family Member".  His other significant power in 
that capacity is the power under cl 17.1 to appoint and remove trustees. 
[87] Powers  of  this  nature  are  not  unique.   A  power  similar  to  that  conferred  on 
Mr Clayton  under  cl  7.1  appeared  in  the  trust  deed  was  considered  by  this  Court  in 
                                                 84  See Official  Assignee  v  Wilson,  above  n 45,  at  [66]  and  [69]â€“[72];  and  see  generally  the 
authorities referred to above at [61], n 59.  85  Tucker, above n 61, at [4â€“030]â€“[4â€“031]. 86  Income Tax Act 2007, s BG1. 87  Official Assignee v Wilson, above n 45, at [68] and [129]. 88  Ward v Ward [2009] NZSC 125, [2010] 2 NZLR 31 at [17]â€“[19]. 89  Law Commission Review of the Law of Trusts (NZLC R130, 2013) at [4.15]. 90  Above at [35] â€“ [36].   Nation  v  Nation,91 but  the  particular  question  we  have  raised  about  the  nature  and 
effect of the power was not raised or considered in that case. 
[88] The  power  under  cl  7.1  is  a  general  power  of  appointment  which  gives 
Mr Clayton the unfettered right to remove the other "Discretionary Beneficiaries" of 
the trust, including those who are also the "Final Beneficiaries", and to leave himself 
as the sole beneficiary entitled to receive the income and capital of the trust under cls 
4.1, 6.1 and 10.1(a).   In  exercising this power of  appointment in his capacity as the 
Principal   Family   Member,   Mr Clayton   owes   no   fiduciary   duties   to   the   other 
beneficiaries  which  he  might  have  owed  if  the  power  had  to  be  exercised  in  his 
capacity as trustee of the VRPT.92 
[89] We do not accept Mr Carruthers' submission that the doctrine of "fraud on a 
power" would constrain Mr Clayton in exercising his power of appointment under 
cl 7.1.  Under that doctrine the donee of the power must exercise it in good faith for 
the donor's purpose.93   
[90] As Tipping J put it in the Supreme Court in Kain v Hutton:94 [46] The  expression  fraud  on  a  power  is  historical  language  for  when  a 
power  is  misused  in  an  ultra  vires  manner.    When  an  appointment  is  made 
pursuant to a power of appointment the person making the appointment (who 
can  be  called  either  the  donee  of  the  power  or  the  appointor)  is  acting 
pursuant  to  a  mandate  granted  by  the  donor  of  the  power  and  must  stay 
within that mandate.  The donor is normally the settlor of an inter vivos trust 
or the testator when the power is contained in a will.   
[47] A  general  power  of  appointment  entitles  the  donee/appointor  to 
appoint  to  anyone  at  all,  including  himself.    There  cannot  therefore  be 
excessive  execution  of,  or  a  fraud  on,  such  a  power because  it  is  logically 
impossible  for  the  donee/appointor  to  exceed  the  donor's  mandate.    By 
contrast a special power enables the donee/appointor to appoint only to those 
specifically permitted by the donor's mandate.  A special power is one where 
the  objects  of  the  power  are  limited  by  the  terms  upon  which  the  power  is 
granted.    An  appointment  to  a  person  who  is  not  a  permitted  object  will 
usually  represent  an  excessive  execution  of  the  power.    The  species  of 
excessive  execution  known  as  a  fraud  on  the  power  normally  comes  about 
when  the  appointment  is  in  form  to  an  object  but  in  substance  to  a  non-                                                 91  Nation v Nation [2005] 3 NZLR 46 (CA) at [18]. 92  Below at [104]â€“[109]. 93  Kain  v  Hutton (CA),  above  n 36,  at  [108]â€“[113];  Geraint Thomas Thomas  on  Powers (2nd  ed, 
Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2012) at [9.01]â€“[9.02]. 94  Kain v Hutton (SC), above n 36.   object.  In such a case the object is simply a vehicle through or by means of 
whom the appointor's purpose of benefiting the non-object  is  carried  out.  
Hence a fraud on a power is a clandestine excessive execution because it is 
regular  on  its  face  but  in  reality  is  undertaken  for  a  purpose  not  within  the 
donor's mandate. [91] Here  there  is  little  doubt  that  one  of  Mr  Clayton's  purposes  as  donor  in 
conferring the general power of appointment on himself as donee was to enable him 
to become the sole beneficiary of the trust if he so wished.  In terms of the power it 
would  not  have  been  improper  for  Mr Clayton  to  exercise  it  in  this  way.    No 
"deliberate defeating" of his own intention would have been involved.   It would, as 
Tipping  J  recognised,  have  been  logically  impossible  for  Mr  Clayton  to  exceed  his 
own mandate. 
[92] We therefore do not accept Mr Carruthers' argument that the court would be 
able  to  constrain  Mr  Clayton  from  exercising  his  general  power  of  appointment 
under cl 7.1 if he decided to do so. 
[93] The question then is whether Mr Clayton's right to exercise his general power 
of  appointment  constituted  "relationship  property"  under  the  PRA  when  he  and 
Mrs Clayton   separated   in   2006,   being   the   date   at   which   her   share   is   to   be 
determined.95  As  already  noted,  the  question  arises  because  of  the  extended 
definition of "property" in the PRA which includes "any other right or interest".96 
[94] The starting point is to recognise that a general power of appointment of this 
nature may give rise to property rights in the hands of the donee of the power.  The 
leading authority is the decision of the Privy Council in TMSF which was referred to 
in both Courts below and in argument before us on appeal.97   
[95] TMSF involved  two  discretionary  trusts  established  by  a  Mr Demirel  in  the 
Cayman Islands with assets of over USD 24,000,000.  The trustee was Merrill Lynch 
Bank  and  Trust  Company  (Cayman)  Ltd.    Mr  Demirel  and  his  wife  and  children 
were  the  beneficiaries  of  the  trusts  and,  as  settlor,  he  retained  a  general  power  of 
                                                 95  Property (Relationships) Act 1976 [PRA], s 2F(1)(b). 96  Section 2, definition of "property", para (e). 97  TMSF above n 23.  See also Kwan v Poon (2014) 17 HKCFAR 414 at [36]; and Thomas, above 
n 93, at [1.06] and [15.38].   revocation  of  the  trusts.   After  Mr  Demirel  was  adjudicated  bankrupt  in Turkey  the 
issue was whether the trusts removed Mr Demirel's assets out of the reach of his 
creditors  for  bankruptcy  purposes  or  whether  the  general  power  of  revocation  was 
itself a property right so that Mr Demirel could be required to delegate his powers of 
revocation to the receivers in his bankruptcy. 
[96] Lord Collins of Mapesbury, delivering the advice of the Privy Council, after 
reviewing  the  relevant  authorities  on  the  question  whether  a  general  power  of 
appointment could give rise to property rights, said: [41] But even  apart from express legislative  intervention general powers 
have been regarded as giving rise to property rights.  In Clarkson v Clarkson 
[1994]  BCC  921 [(CA)] (a  decision  on  the  definition  of  property  in the 
Insolvency Act   1986,   section   283(4))   Hoffmann   LJ   referred   to In   re 
Mathieson [[1927] 1 Ch 283 (CA)] and said, obiter, (at p 931):  
I  think that  even  at  the  time  this  was  quite  a remarkable 
decision.  Lord  St  Leonards  [ie Sugden] in  his  book  on Powers 
8th ed (1861)  said: "To  take  a distinction  between  a  general 
power and a limitation in fee is  to grasp at a  shadow while the 
substance escapes." 
[42] So  also  in In  re  Triffitt's  Settlement [1958]  Ch  852 [(Ch)],  861, 
Upjohn J  said that "where there is a completely general power in its widest 
sense,  that  is tantamount to ownership".  That  was  in  the  context  of  the 
question, discussed below, whether a power could be delegated. 
[43] As Thomas, Powers (1998)  puts  it  (at  para  1-08),  the  fundamental 
distinction  between  the  concepts  of  power  and  property  has  not  been 
preserved in  all  contexts  and  for  all  purposes.  A  donee  of  a  truly  general 
power can appoint the subject-matter of the power to himself.  He therefore 
has  an "absolute disposing power" over the property, citing Sugden, 8th  ed 
(1861), p 394.  Consequently, for many purposes, the law regards the donee 
as the effective owner of that property. [97] Then, applying this approach to Mr Demirel's case, Lord Collins said: [59] In  the  opinion  of  their  Lordships  the  decisions  in Masri  (No  2) 
[[2008]  EWCA  Civ  303,]  [2009]  QB  450 and  its predecessors  lead  to  the 
conclusion that in the present case the jurisdiction should be exercised.  The 
powers  of revocation are  such  that in equity, in the circumstances of a  case 
such  as  this,  Mr  Demirel  can  be  regarded  as  having rights  tantamount  to 
ownership. The interests of justice require that an order be made in order to 
make effective the judgment of the Cayman court recognizing and enforcing 
the Turkish judgment. 
[60] There  is  no invariable  rule  that a  power is  distinct from  ownership. 
Nor (as the cases on the rule against perpetuities show) is there an invariable   rule  that  any  departure  from  the  distinction  between  power  and  property  is 
effected  solely  by  legislation. As  Lord  St  Leonards  said  (and  Hoffmann  LJ 
approved), "To take a distinction between a general power and a limitation in 
fee is to grasp at a shadow while the substance escapes", and in In re Triffitt's 
Settlement [1958]  Ch  852 [(Ch)], 861 Upjohn J said that "where there is a 
completely   general power   in   its   widest   sense,   that   is   tantamount   to 
ownership". [98] On  this  basis  the  Privy  Council  held  that  the  property  in  the  trusts  remained 
Mr Demirel's and ordered him to delegate his powers of revocation to the receivers. 
[99] In  our view,  for  the  following  reasons,  the  approach  of  the  Privy  Council  in 
TMSF should be followed here with the result that Mr Clayton's general  power  of 
appointment  under  cl  7.1  of  the VRPT  constituted  a  property  right  in  his  hands  for 
the purposes of the PRA. 
[100] First, there is no good reason why in New Zealand the traditional distinction 
between the concepts of power and property should be preserved in all contexts and 
for  all  purposes.98  Subject  to  the  terms  and  nature  of  the  particular  power,  the 
context in which it has been conferred and any relevant legislative provisions, when 
the  donee  of  the  power  is  entitled  to  appoint  the  subject  matter  of  the  power  to 
himself  or  herself  without  regard  to  the  interests  of  others  the  law  may  regard  the 
donee as the effective owner of that property.99  In such a case, the fact that the donee 
has  an  "absolute  disposing  power"  may  be  recognised  in  practical  terms   as 
conferring a property right.100 
[101] Second, there is no practical distinction between the power to revoke the trust 
the  subject  of  the  decision  in TMSF and Mr Clayton's power to appoint himself as 
the sole beneficiary of the VRPT.   If Mr Clayton  were to exercise his power in this 
way,  he  would  become  both  the  legal  and  beneficial  owner  of  the  trust  assets  and 
there would then be no trust at all.101  He would effectively have revoked the trust. 
                                                 98  Thomas, above n 93, at [1.06]. 99  Mark O'Regan  and Andrew Butler  "Equity  and  Trusts  in  a  Family  Law  Context" (paper 
presented  to  New  Zealand  Law  Society  Family  Law  Conference,  November  2011)  267 at 
291â€“292. 100  Thomas, above n 93, at [1.06]. 101  See above at [47].   [102] Third, it is clear from an examination of the VRPT deed that Mr Clayton, as 
settlor,  intended  to  confer  the  power  of  appointment  under  cl  7.1  on  himself  in  his 
capacity as the "Principal Family Member" and not in his capacity as trustee.  There 
is no reason why this careful bifurcation of Mr Clayton's roles under the VRPT deed 
should  not  be  recognised  and  upheld  with  the  consequences  that  flow  from  it.    We 
have upheld the findings of the Courts below that Mr Clayton genuinely intended to 
create  a  valid  trust.102  We  consider  that  he  also  genuinely  intended  to  confer  the 
power under cl 7.1 on himself in his separate capacity as the "Principal Family 
Member". 
[103] Fourth, two important consequences flow from the fact that Mr Clayton held 
this power in this capacity: 
(a) the doctrine of "fraud on a power" has no application;103 and 
(b) he would owe no fiduciary obligations to anyone when exercising the 
power in his own interests. 
[104] Fiduciary obligations are not usually imposed by the courts on the exercise of 
a  general  power  of  appointment  of  this  nature.104  This  is  because  the  courts 
recognise that a power of this nature is personal to the donee and may be  exercised 
by the donee exclusively in his or her own interests.  As Buckley J put it in Re Will's 
Trust Deeds, where the trust deed provided that the trust could be wholly or partially 
revoked and new trusts created for a broad class of beneficiaries:105 If  the  donee be  himself  an  object  of  the  power  so  that  he  could  at  his  own 
option appoint the whole of the trust property in his own favour, I conceive 
that  it  would  be  impossible  to  regard  the  power  as  having  any  fiduciary 
character, for such a power would be equivalent to ownership ... .                                                  102  See above at [67]â€“[68]. 103  See above at [89]â€“[92]. 104  Hayton, Matthews and Mitchell, above n 65, at [1.76] and [8.88], Fox, above n 62, 285 at [11â€“
001], and Thomas, above n 93, at [1.55]. 105  Re Will's Trust Deeds [1964] Ch 219 at 228.   [105] Buckley   J   also   recognised   the   same   approach   applied   when,   as   in 
Mr Clayton's  case,  a  power  is  conferred  on  a  person  who  is  a  trustee  but  in  a 
different capacity:106 ...  where  a  power is  conferred  on someone  who  is  not  a  trustee  of the 
property  to  which  the  power  relates  or,  if  he  be  such  a  trustee,  is  not 
conferred on him in that capacity, then in the absence of a trust in favour of 
the objects of the power in default of appointment, the donee is, at any rate 
prima facie, not under any duty recognisable by the court to exercise a power 
such as to disenable him from releasing the power. [106] The distinction between a power given to an individual in a personal capacity 
and a power given to a trustee was acknowledged by Lord Reid in In re Gulbenkian's 
Settlements:107 It may be true that when a mere power is given to an individual he is under 
no duty to exercise it or even to consider whether he should exercise it.  But 
when a power is given to trustees as such, it appears to me that the situation 
must  be  different.   A  settlor  or  trustee  who  entrusts  a  power  to  his  trustees 
must  be  relying  on  them  in  their  fiduciary  capacity  so  they  cannot  simply 
push  aside  the  power  and  refuse  to  consider  whether  it  ought  in  their 
judgment to be exercised. [107] The view that fiduciary obligations do not attach to a power conferred on an 
individual personally, who is also a trustee, was accepted by French CJ in Kennon v 
Spry, which concerned the application of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth):108 Dr Spry  created  the  trust.    He  was  the  settlor.    He  so  designated  himself  in 
cl 1  of  the  1981  instrument.    He  appointed  himself  as  trustee.  He  assumed 
the  power  to  appoint  and  remove  further  trustees.    He  did so,  according  to 
the  terms  of  the  1981  instrument,  in  his  personal  capacity.    The  power  to 
vary the trust he conferred upon himself personally as "the settlor".  That 
power was not constrained by fiduciary duties. ... [108] A general  power  to  appoint  and  remove  beneficiaries,  which  is  held  by  a 
person in a capacity other than as a trustee, may therefore be exercised by the holder 
of  the  power  without  consideration  of  the  interests  of  either  the  beneficiaries 
removed or appointed.  To hold otherwise would constrain the exercise of the power 
                                                 106  At 237. 107  In re Gulbenkian's Settlements, above n 54, at 518. 108  Kennon  v  Spry [2008]  HCA  56, (2008)  238  CLR  366 at  [46].  Gummow,  Hayne  and  Kiefel  JJ 
determined the case in the same  way as French CJ but without addressing this issue.  Heydon J 
dissented.  The result reached in that case is not material for present purposes as it was decided 
in the context of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth); see Nicola Peart "Intervention to Prevent the 
Abuse of Trust Structures" [2010] NZ L Rev 567 at 591.   contrary to the donor's intentions.  It would have the effect of converting the general 
power  into  a  special  power  by  requiring  the  holder  of  the  power  to  consider  the 
interests  of  others  contrary  to  his  or  her  entitlement  to  exercise  the  power  solely  in 
his or her own interests.109   
[109] Here  Mr  Clayton  as  donor  intended  that  he  should  be  entitled  as  donee  to 
exercise his general power to remove the other beneficiaries and  appoint himself as 
the  sole  beneficiary  acting  exclusively  in  his  own  interests.    While  he  might  have 
owed  fiduciary  obligations  if  the  power  under  cl  7.1  had  been  conferred  on  him  as 
trustee, it was not.110 
[110] We  express  no  view  on  the  question  whether  Mr  Clayton's  power  as 
"Principal Family Member" under cl 17.1 to appoint and remove trustees might have 
been  subject  to  fiduciary  obligations  because  the  other  discretionary  beneficiaries 
might  have  been  entitled  to  expect  that  power  to  be  used  to  appoint  trustees  who 
were suitable for the position.111  That question does not arise in this case. 
[111] Finally, this approach is supported by the provisions of the PRA.  As already 
noted, "property" is defined in s 2 of the PRA as including "any other right or 
interest".112  This is an extended definition which should be interpreted consistently 
with  the  purpose  and  principles  of  the  PRA  which  are  to  ensure  a  just  division  of 
relationship  property  by  recognising  the  equal  contributions  of  both  spouses  to  the 
marriage  partnership.113  On this basis Mr Clayton's general power of appointment 
under cl 7.1 of the VRPT deed is within the definition because it is a "right" and 
creates an "interest".  Mr Clayton had the right to exercise the power of appointment 
in  his  own  favour.    That  right  itself  constituted  "property"  and  hence  was 
"relationship property" under the PRA when the parties separated in 2006.

Family Property (online looseleaf ed, Thomson Reuters) at [PR2.24.01]. 113  PRA, ss 1M and 1N.  See also M v B [2006] 3 NZLR 660 (CA) at [34] per Robertson J and [227] 
per Hammond J.   [112] We have not overlooked Mr Carruthers' submission that express provisions in 
the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 relating to general 
powers  of  appointment  would  not  have  been  necessary  if  such  powers  constituted 
property in the hands of the donee.114  The short answer to this submission is that, as 
the  Privy  Council  recognised  in TMSF,  general  powers  may  give  rise  to  property 
rights "even apart from express legislative intervention".115 
[113] Once  it  is  recognised  that  Mr  Clayton's  right  to  exercise  his  power  of 
appointment constituted "relationship property" under the PRA, the next question is 
the value of that right.  In our view the value of the right to the holder of the power 
in a case such as this one will be the value of the property received in the event that 
the power were exercised, that is, the net value of the assets of the trust.  In this case 
that will be the net value of the assets of the VRPT calculated as at 31 March 2011, 
being  the  date  agreed  by  the  parties.    The  parties  are also in  agreement  that  the 
calculation of  the  quantum should  be  remitted  to  the  High  Court  for  determination.  
Mrs Clayton will be entitled to an equal share in the value of that property, being the 
net value of Mr Clayton's equity in the assets of the VRPT. 
[114] In  reaching  this  conclusion,  we  recognise  that,  while  we  have  accepted  that 
the VRPT was a valid trust, Mr Clayton, in settling the trust, has failed to remove the 
value of its assets from the reach of the PRA.  This is because he retained the right to 
exercise  his  general  power  of  appointment  under  cl  7.1.    This  power  does  not 
invalidate the trust or mean that Mr Clayton, as trustee, does not hold the property of 
the  trust  for  the  beneficiaries.   The  trust  remains  in  existence  and  is  enforceable  by 
the other beneficiaries.  Their rights and Mr Clayton's obligations as trustee continue 
unless and until he exercises his power under cl 7.1 to remove them as beneficiaries.  
But  in  the  meantime,  in  terms of the extended definition of "property" in the PRA, 
the existence of the power under cl 7.1 also has the effect of bringing the net value of 
the assets of the trust as at 31 March 2011 into the pool of "relationship property".  
This outcome, based on our analysis of recent developments in the recognition of a 
power  of  this  nature  as  a  property  right,  is  consistent  with  both  the  law  relating  to 
                                                 114  See  Estate  and  Gift  Duties  Act  1966,  s  8;  and  Ivor  Richardson  and  Robin  Congreve Law  of 
Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed, Butterworths, Wellington, 1978) at 80â€“81. 115  TMSF, above n 23, at [41] and [60].   trusts and powers and the underlying purpose and principles of the PRA.116  The fact 
that Parliament enacted ss 44 and 44C of the PRA does not preclude the Court from 
reaching this conclusion based on the extended definition of "property" in the PRA. 
The answers to the questions 
[115] While  our  formal  answers  to  the  first  two  questions  are  unfavourable  to 
Mrs Clayton,  in practical  terms,  as  our  qualification  to  the  first  answer  records,  she 
has been successful on this issue.  For this reason it is unnecessary for us to answer 
the third question. 
[116] Accordingly, we answer the questions: 
(a) Did  the  Courts  below  err  in  finding that  the Vaughan  Road 
Property Trust was illusory? 
Answer: Yes, but Mr Clayton's right to exercise his general power of 
appointment under cl 7.1 of the trust deed was "relationship 
property." 
(b) Did  the  Courts  below  err  in  finding  the  Vaughan  Road 
Property Trust was not a sham? 
Answer: No. 
(c) Is  Mrs  Clayton  entitled  to  a  compensation  order  under 
s 44C of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 in relation to 
dispositions made to the Vaughan Road Property Trust? 
Answer: It is unnecessary to answer this question. 
                                                 116  Cf [81]â€“[85] above.   The Education Trusts 
The settlement of the two education trusts in 2004 
[117] In  2004  two  trusts  were  settled  by  Mr  Grant  Dunn,  a  solicitor  of  Buddle 
Findlay who were Mr Clayton's lawyers.  These were the Stacey Clayton Education 
Trust (SCET) and the Anna Clayton Education Trust (ACET).   
[118] The  trusts  were  settled  following  advice  Mr Clayton  obtained  in  2003  from 
Vivienne Ullrich QC discussing the risks to Mr Clayton and his business interests of 
a marital separation.  Ms Ullrich's advice was not in evidence. 
[119] The  trustees  of  the  SCET  and  ACET  are  Mr  Clayton  and  Mr  Cheshire.  
Mr Clayton has power to appoint new trustees.  The discretionary beneficiaries of the 
two  trusts  are  respectively,  Stacey  and  Anna.    Other  discretionary  beneficiaries  of 
both   trusts   are   Mr   Clayton,   any   nominated   business   associate,   employee   or 
consultant  of  any  business  connected  with  him,  any  child,  grandchild  or  great 
grandchild of Stacey or Anna respectively, any relative of Mr Clayton, any company 
in  which  any  of  the  previous  beneficiaries  have  at  least  a  10  per  cent  shareholding, 
any  trust  of  which  any  of  the  previous  beneficiaries  are  a  beneficiary,  and  any 
charitable organisation.  Mrs Clayton is not a beneficiary. 
[120] As noted in the Courts below, while the trusts were ostensibly set up for the 
benefit  of  Stacey  and  Anna,  neither  is  a  final  beneficiary  and  there  is  nothing  to 
indicate  that  they  have  anything  more  than  an  expectation,  like  any  of  the  other 
discretionary beneficiaries.117 
The assets of the trusts 
[121] Each trust owns a section at Collingwood Drive in Brunswick Park, Rotorua 
and a half share in land on which one of the Claymark sawmills operates.  The two 
sections were acquired in 2005.  The deposits were funded by part of the proceeds of 
sale  of  a  holiday  property  at  Lake  Rotoiti  which  had  been bought  for  $410,000  in 
                                                 117  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [88]; High Court judgment, above n 1, at [94].   2003   and   held   in   the   name   of Lake Rotoiti Retreat Ltd.      It   was   sold   for 
approximately $600,000 and the title transferred on 8 March 2004. 
[122] The  Carter  Holt  Harvey  sawmill  business  at View  and  McCloskey  Roads  in 
Rotorua  was  acquired  by  Rotorua  Sawmill  Ltd  in  2004.      The  land  on  which  the 
sawmill  was sited  was  acquired  by  SCET  for  $450,000  and ACET  for  a  little  over 
$300,000.  It appears that these costs of purchase were funded by borrowings. 
[123] As at 31 March 2011, the trusts each owed over $370,000 to Mr Clayton and 
other entities.  The debts were recorded in the trusts' accounts as loans (of $307,675 
and $306,781 in relation to the VRPT) and as advances from Claymark Finance Ltd 
and Mr Clayton.  The debts owed to Mr Clayton personally were recorded as $1,605 
and  $1,604.   The  advances from Claymark Finance  Ltd  were  assets in  the  hands  of 
Mr  Clayton because he  was  and  remains  the  100  per  cent  shareholder of  that 
company  and  the  value  of  those  shares  would  be  part  of  the  overall  pool  of 
relationship property.  
[124] In addition Mr Clayton had gifted $20,000 to each of the trusts. 
[125] Mr  Carruthers  for  Mr  Clayton  accepted  that  the advances  of  approximately 
$1,600 to each trust were relationship property. 
Mrs Clayton's claim 
[126] Mrs Clayton claims that she is entitled to a half share in the current equity of 
the properties owned by the two trusts.  Her claim is based on s 44 of the PRA which 
provides: 44 Dispositions may be set aside 
(1) Where  the  High  Court  or  a  District  Court  or  a  Family  Court  is 
satisfied that any disposition of property has been made, whether for 
value or not, by or on behalf of or by direction of or in the interests 
of  any  person  in  order  to  defeat  the  claim  or  rights  of  any  person 
(party  B)  under  this  Act,  the  court  may  make  any  order  under 
subsection (2).   (1A) The court may make an order under this section on the application of 
party  B,  or  (in  any  proceedings  under  this Act  or  otherwise)  on  its 
own initiative. 
(2) In any case to which subsection (1) applies, the court may, subject to 
subsection (4),â€” 
(a) order that any person to whom the disposition was made and 
who  received  the  property  otherwise  than  in  good  faith  and 
for    valuable    consideration,    or    his    or    her    personal 
representative, shall transfer the property or any part thereof 
to such person as the court directs; or 
(b) order that any person to whom the disposition was made and 
who  received  the  property  otherwise  than  in  good  faith  and 
for    adequate    consideration,    or    his    or    her    personal 
representative,  shall pay into court, or to such person as the 
court directs, a sum not exceeding the difference between the 
value  of  the  consideration  (if  any)  and  the  value  of  the 
property; or 
(c) order that any person who has, otherwise than in good faith 
and  for  valuable  consideration,  received  any  interest  in  the 
property  from  the  person  to  whom  the  disposition  was  so 
made,  or  his  or  her  personal  representative,  or  any  person 
who  received  that  interest  from  any  such  person  otherwise 
than  in  good  faith  and  for  valuable  consideration,  shall 
transfer  that  interest  to  such  person  as  the  court  directs,  or 
shall  pay into  court  or  to  such  person  as  the  court  directs  a 
sum not exceeding the value of the interest. 
(3) For  the  purposes of giving effect to any order under subsection (2), 
the court may make such further order as it thinks fit. 
(4) Relief (whether under this section, or in equity, or otherwise) in any 
case  to  which  subsection  (1)  applies  shall  be  denied  wholly  or  in 
part, if the person from whom relief is sought received the property 
or  interest  in  good  faith,  and  has  so  altered  his  or  her  position  in 
reliance on his or her having an indefeasible interest in the property 
or  interest  that  in  the  opinion  of  the  court,  having  regard  to  all 
possible  implications in respect of other persons, it is inequitable to 
grant relief, or to grant relief in full, as the case may be. The Family Court findings 
[127] In the Family Court Judge Munro found that s 44 of the PRA applied to these 
two trusts so that Mrs Clayton was entitled to a half share in the current equity of the 
properties owned by the trusts.118  The Judge's reasons for this finding were:119 
                                                 118  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [92]â€“[93]. 119  At [92].   (a) The  gifts  of  $20,000,  together  with  the  interest  free  advances  by 
Mr Clayton and his companies, were dispositions of property. 
(b) An  intention  to  defeat  Mrs  Clayton's  interests  was  uppermost  in 
Mr Clayton's mind, given that she was specifically excluded from the 
wide-ranging list of discretionary beneficiaries. 
The High Court findings 
[128] In  the  High  Court  Rodney  Hansen  J  upheld  the  Family  Court  decision  in 
respect of these trusts.  The Judge first rejected a submission for Mr Clayton that, as 
Mrs Clayton was a "relative" of Mr Clayton,  she  was  a  beneficiary  of  the  trusts.120  
This submission has not been pursued on appeal. 
[129] The Judge then said: [101] Of  greater  substance  is  the  further  submission  that,  contrary  to  the 
Judge's finding, there was in fact no disposition.  Mr Carruthers submitted 
that the finding that Mr Clayton made a  gift of $20,000 to each Trust is not 
supported by the evidence.  However, it appears that the proceeds of sale of 
the  Rotoiti  property  were  used  to  fund  the  deposits.    There  is  nothing  to 
indicate  any  obligation to  repay  those  amounts.   The  balance  of  the  cost  of 
acquiring  the  land  appears  to  have  been  met  by  way  of  advances  from  the 
Vaughan Road Property Trust or bank borrowing.   
[102] In my view, the Judge's finding that the land was acquired by the 
two "educational" trusts and dispositions made for that purpose were  with 
the  intention  of  defeating  Mrs  Clayton's  claim  is  fully  justified.    The 
omission  of  Mrs  Clayton  as  a  beneficiary  during  the  subsistence  of  the 
marriage  admits  of  no  other  rational explanation.    It  is  relevant  too that  the 
land on which the sawmill stands which was acquired (it appears) for a total 
of $750,000, was valued in the accounts of each trust as at 31 March 2011 at 
$1.28m.  I was told the land was transferred at book value at the vendor's 
request.  I infer that significant unrealised profits arose on the transfer of the 
land to the trust. The appeal 
[130] Mr Clayton and Mr Cheshire, as the trustees of the two trusts, appeal against 
the  findings  of  the  Courts  below  that  s  44  applied.    Mr  Carruthers  submits  that  the 
findings were erroneous because: 
                                                 120  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [99]â€“[100].   (a) The  evidence  established  that  no  gifts  were  made  to  either  of  the 
trusts.    Mr  Clayton  advanced  $1,605  to  the  SCET  and  $1,604  to  the 
ACET. 
(b) No  interest  fee  advances  were  made  by  Mr  Clayton  or  "his 
companies" to either of the trusts. 
(c) In  any  event  those  advances  could  not  constitute  a  disposition  of 
property for the purposes of s 44(1). 
(d) As Lake Rotoiti Retreat Ltd sold its property in 2003 (in fact, it would 
appear, 2004), the proceeds were not used to fund the deposits for the 
two sections in Rotorua. 
(e) The  value of  the  sawmill  land  was  not  $1,280,000  as  at  31 March 
2011.  That value was inclusive of improvements.  
(f) In terms of s 44(2), the dispositions, even if made, could not give rise 
to  the  award  of  a  half  share  in  the  equity  of  the  properties  owned  by 
the trusts.  The remedy  was as to the amount of  the disposition to be 
met from trust income, ameliorated by the factors listed in "s 44(6) 
[sic]". 
[131] The two questions relating to the two trusts are: (a) Was there any disposition of property by Mr Clayton to the trustees of either 
of the SCET and the ACET so  as  to support orders made under s  44 of the 
PRA? 
(b) If  there  were  dispositions  made  for  the  purpose  of  land  acquired  by  the 
SCET and  the ACET with the  intention  of  defeating  Mrs Clayton's claim, 
does  s  44(2)  of  the  PRA  authorise  the  court  to  order  that  Mrs Clayton  is 
entitled to half the net equity of the SCET and the ACET?   [132] As   these   questions   recognise,   three   issues   arise   as   to   the   interpretation   and 
application of s 44, namely: 
(a) Were there any "dispositions" by Mr Clayton to the trusts? 
(b) If so, were they made with the intention of defeating Mrs Clayton's claim?  
(c) If  so,  should  the  court  make  an  order  under  s  44(2)  that  Mrs Clayton  is 
entitled to half the net equity of the two trusts?  [133] The expression "disposition" is not separately  defined  in  the  PRA,  but  there 
is  no  dispute  that  it  should  be  given  a  broad  meaning  extending  to  include  a 
disposition  by  way  of  nomination,  that  is  a  direction  as  to  how  property  is  to  be 
transferred.121  Mr Carruthers did not take issue with this approach. 
[134] The meaning of the expression "made ... in order to defeat the claim or rights 
of  any  person" was considered by this Court in SM  v  ASB  Bank  Ltd.122  In  the 
judgment of the Court delivered by Randerson J it was said: [52] For  the  purposes  of  s  44(1)  a disposition  of  property  must  be  made 
with  the  intention  or  purpose  of  defeating  the  claim  of  a  person  under  the 
PRA.  We  do  not  accept  the  conclusion  reached  by  the  Judge  that  it  is 
sufficient  if  the  disposition  has  the  effect  of  defeating  a  legitimate  claim 
under  the  PRA.  If  that  were  the  appropriate  test,  then  any  disposition  of  a 
property  which  was the  subject  of  an  occupation order  (or a  claim  for such 
an  order)  would  inevitably  be  caught  by  s  44(1).  Our  conclusion  in  this 
respect is supported by the clear distinction drawn between the two concepts 
of intention and effect in s 47(1) and (2) of the PRA. 
[53] The  effect  of  a  disposition  may  be  one  factor  in  the  assessment  of 
whether it was made in order to defeat the claim or rights of any person but 
this  fact  is  not  dispositive. The  task  is  to  assess  the  intention  or  purpose  of 
the  person  or  body  disposing  of  the  property  at  the  time  the  disposition  is 
made. That requires an assessment of all the relevant evidence.                                                  121  Re Polkinghorne Trust, Kidd v Kidd (1988) 3 FRNZ 636 (HC) at 640; Bill Atkin "Protecting the 
Non-Owner  Spouse  or Partner"  in  RL  Fisher  (ed) Fisher  on  Matrimonial  and  Relationship 
Property (online   looseleaf   ed,   LexisNexis)   at   [9.43]; Family   Property,   above   n 112 at 
[PP44.02(1)]. 122  SM v ASB Bank Ltd [2012] NZCA 103, (2012) 28 FRNZ 782.  It is not necessary in this case for 
us  to  address  the  submission  for  Mrs  Clayton  that  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in Regal 
Castings Ltd v Lightbody [2008] NZSC 87, [2009] 2 NZLR 433 widens the scope of s 44.   [135] In the  event that the court is satisfied that dispositions were made which are 
caught  by  s  44(1),  the  court  has  wide  powers  under  s  44(2)  as  to  the  form  of  relief 
that may be granted. 
Were there any dispositions? 
[136] We  accept  the  submissions  for  Mrs  Clayton  that  the  dispositions  were 
established on the evidence. 
[137] In respect of the Collingwood Drive sections, the evidence is clear that there 
was a disposition by way of nomination.  Mr Clayton said in his affidavit: Funds from the sale of the Lake Rotoiti property were also used as deposits 
in two sections in Collingwood Drive, Brunswick Park, Rotorua which were 
acquired  in  2005.    These  were  purchased  by  the  Stacey  Clayton  Education 
Trust  and  the  Anna  Clayton  Education  Trust  respectively  with  a  view  that 
Stacey  and Anna  would  each  be  able  to  build  on  the respective  sections  in 
the  future.    The  cost  of  each  section  was  approximately  $300,000.    Other 
than these deposits these purchases were again funded by Bank borrowings. [138] Mr Clayton's evidence as to the source of the deposits for the two sections 
was  confirmed by  the  title  for  the  Lake  Rotoiti  property  which  showed  that  it  was 
transferred  on  8  March  2004  and  the deposit  slips  dated  8  February 2005 which 
showed that  Mr  Clayton  paid  the two deposits ($33,500  each, totalling  $67,000  for 
both sections). 
[139] Mr  Carruthers  attempted  to  persuade  us  that  there  was  evidence  in  the  trust 
accounts  and  from  Mr  Clayton's  accountant,  Mr  Giesbers,   to   suggest   that 
Mr Clayton's evidence was incorrect.  We are not prepared to accept this accounting 
evidence in the face of Mr Clayton's own evidence which he has not sought to 
correct. 
[140] In  respect  of  the  Rotorua sawmill  land,  the  evidence  is  also  clear  that  there 
was a disposition.  Mr Clayton said in evidence in the Family Court: Further expansion of the Claymark business occurred in 2004.  In particular 
the Carter Holt mill business at View and McCloskey Roads, in Rotorua was 
acquired by Rotorua Sawmill Limited and the relevant land was acquired by 
the  Stacey  Clayton  Education  Trust  for  approximately  $450,000  and  the   Anna Clayton Education Trust for a little over $300,000 through borrowings 
made by those trusts. [141] As Lady Chambers for Mrs Clayton submitted: 
(a) Mr Carruthers  has  not  challenged  the  High  Court  finding  that  there 
was  no  indication  that  the  amounts  advanced  by  Mr Clayton  and  the 
VRPT were to be repaid;123 and 
(b) it is well-established that loans and advances are dispositions to which 
s 44 can apply.  
Were the dispositions made to defeat Mrs Clayton's rights? 
[142] There  is  no  real  dispute  that  the  dispositions  were  made  to  the  two  trusts  in 
order to defeat Mrs Clayton's rights.  The exclusion of Mrs Clayton as a beneficiary 
after   advice   from   Ms   Ullrich   showed   that   this   intention   was   uppermost   in 
Mr Clayton's  mind.    Mr  Cheshire,  the  other  trustee,  shared  that intention.  His 
evidence was that: One  of  the  key  risks  identified  at  the  time  was  the  effect  on  the  company 
banking arrangements should Mark's marriage run into difficulties. [143] There was therefore ample evidence to support the finding to this effect in the 
Courts below.  We are not prepared to overturn their concurrent findings. 
Should there be any order under s 44(2)? 
[144] Once  the  court  is  satisfied  that  a  disposition  has  been  made  to  defeat  the 
interests  of a  claimant,  the  court  has  wide  powers  under  s  44(2)  to  make  orders  for 
the purpose of compensating the person whose claim or rights have been defeated by 
the disposition.  As the court is expressly empowered to make "any order" of the 
orders  listed  in  s  44(2) and "such further order as it thinks fit", the orders are not 
mutually exclusive and may be combined to provide a just outcome.124 
[145] The   Courts   below   were   therefore   authorised   to   make   the   orders   that 
                                                 123  Above at [129]. 124  May v Close (1989) 5 FRNZ 233 (HC) at 236; Atkin, above n 121, at [9.47].   Mrs Clayton was entitled to half of the net equity in the properties owned by the two 
trusts as at 31 March 2011. 
[146] We  assume  that  Mr  Carruthers'  reference  to  the  factors  listed  in  s 44(6) 
should have been to the factors in s 44(4).  We are not satisfied, however, that there 
was evidence to support Mr Clayton's claim that Mrs Clayton should be denied relief 
in whole or in part under this provision. 
The answers to the questions 
[147] Accordingly, we answer the two questions as follows: 
(a) Was there any disposition of property by Mr Clayton to the 
trustees of either of the SCET and the ACET Trust so as to 
support orders made under s 44 of the PRA? 
Answer:  Yes. 
(b) If  there  were  dispositions  made  for  the  purpose  of  land 
acquired  by  the SCET and  the ACET with the  intention  of 
defeating  Mrs Clayton's  claim,  does  s  44(2)  of  the  PRA 
authorise  the  court  to  order  that  Mrs  Clayton  is  entitled  to 
half the net equity of the SCET and the ACET? 
Answer:  Yes. 
Claymark Trust 
The settlement of the Claymark Trust 
[148] Mr Clayton settled the Claymark Trust on 10 May 1994, during the marriage.  
The first  trustees  were  Mr  Clayton;  an  accountant  and  a  solicitor.    Mr  and  Mrs 
Clayton   are   discretionary   beneficiaries   and   their   two   daughters   are   the   final 
beneficiaries. 
[149] After   the  Trust   was   established   it   acquired   two   properties   in   Katikati 
adjoining the sawmill there.  It also owns shares in Kaimai Developments Ltd which   has an avocado orchard on the adjacent land. 
[150] Mr Clayton made three gifts of $27,000 to this Trust between 1995 and 1998.  
He also made advances to the Trust.  As at 31 March 2011, he was owed $5,093. 
The trust assets 
[151] The  trust  assets  as  at  31 March  2011  are  the  two  Katikati  properties  and  the 
shares, as well as, most significantly, current accounts and loans to each of the VRPT 
and  Kaimai  Developments  Ltd.    The  current  account  for  the  VRPT  is recorded  as 
$1,416,390  and  the  loan  as  $367,309.    For  Kaimai  Developments  Ltd,  the  current 
account  value  is  $90,509  and  the  loan  is  $449,345.    The  net  asset  position  is 
$1,342,307.  
Mrs Clayton's claim 
[152] Mrs  Clayton  claims  compensation  in  relation  to  dispositions  made  to  the 
Claymark  Trust.    Her  claim  is  based  on  s  44C  of  the  PRA  and  s  182  of  the  Family 
Proceedings  Act  1980  (the  FPA).    It  is  convenient  to  address  the  two  claims 
separately. 
(a) Claim under s 44C of the PRA 
[153] Section 44C of the PRA provides: 44C Compensation for property disposed of to trust 
(1) This section applies if the court is satisfiedâ€” 
(a) that,  since  the  marriage,  the  civil  union,  or  the  de  facto 
relationship  began,  either  or  both  spouses  or  partners  have 
disposed of relationship property to a trust; and 
(b) that  the  disposition  has  the  effect  of  defeating  the  claim  or 
rights of one of the spouses or partners; and 
(c) that the disposition is not one to which section 44 applies. 
(2) If  this  section  applies,  the  court  may  make  1  or  more  of  the 
following  orders  for  the  purpose  of  compensating  the  spouse  or 
partner  whose claim  or  rights  under  this Act  have  been  defeated  by 
the disposition:   (a) an order requiring one  spouse or partner to pay to the  other 
spouse   or   partner   a   sum   of   money,   whether   out   of 
relationship property or separate property: 
(b) an  order  requiring  one  spouse  or  partner  to  transfer  to  the 
other spouse or partner any property, whether the property is 
relationship property or separate property: 
(c) an  order  requiring  the  trustees  of  the  trust  to  pay  to  one 
spouse  or  partner  the  whole  or  part  of  the  income  of  the 
trust, either for a specified period or until a specified amount 
has been paid. 
(3) The court must not make an order under subsection (2)(c) ifâ€” 
(a) an  order  under  subsection  (2)(a)  or  (b)  would  compensate 
the spouse or partner; or 
(b) a   third   person   has   in   good   faith   altered   that   person's 
positionâ€” 
(i) in reliance on the ability of the trustees to distribute 
the  income  of  the  trust  in  terms  of  the  instrument 
creating the trust; and 
(ii) in  such  a  way  that  it  would  be  unjust  to  make  the 
order. 
(4) The  court  may  make  1  or  more  orders  under  subsection  (2)  if  it 
considers it just to do so, having regard toâ€” 
(a) the value of the relationship property disposed of to the trust: 
(b) the value of the relationship property available for division: 
(c) the   date   or   dates   on   which   relationship   property   was 
disposed of to the trust: 
(d) whether the  trust gave  consideration for the  property, and  if 
so, the amount of the consideration: 
(e) whether  the  spouses  or  partners,  or  either  of  them,  or  any 
child of the marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship, is 
or has been a beneficiary of the trust: 
(f) any other relevant matter. The Family Court findings 
[154] In the Family Court Judge Munro's relevant findings arise where she rejected 
Mrs Clayton's claim for compensation under s 44 in relation to dispositions made to   the Claymark Trust.125  She found that the Trust had operated as a bona fide business 
trust.126  She  accepted  evidence  that  it  was  set  up  for  business  purposes  which 
included  acquiring  the  properties  around  the  sawmill,  with  the  aim  of  forestalling 
any   nuisance   complaints   from neighbouring lifestyle   properties   (including   by 
planting  the  avocado  orchard)  and  reducing  difficulties  obtaining  resource  consents 
during  the  expansion  of  the  sawmill.   As  Rodney  Hansen  J  said  in  the  High  Court, 
the Judge did not deal directly with a claim based on s 44C.127 
The High Court findings 
[155] In  the  High  Court  Rodney  Hansen  J  upheld  the  Family  Court  decision  in 
respect of this trust.128  The Judge said:129 [145] In Nation v Nation the Court of Appeal summarised the requirements 
for a successful claim under s 44C.  The disposition must be: 
(a) to a trust;  
(b) of relationship property; 
(c) made since the relationship began; 
(d) made by either or both of the partners; 
(e) one to which s 44 does not apply; and 
(f) one that has the effect of defeating the claim or rights of one 
of the partners. 
[146] The   gifts   totalling   $81,000   and   the   loans   of   $60,365   were 
dispositions to a trust made by Mr Clayton since the relationship began.  The 
transfer of funds is a disposition even if it is made by way of an interest-free 
loan â€“ Nation v Nation; Rabson v Gallagher.  They could have had the effect 
of defeating Mrs Clayton's claim or rights in the sense discussed in those 
cases. 
[147] Ms  Hunter submitted  that  in  terms  of  the Rabson  v  Gallagher 
paradigm, the Judge ought to have taken into account the ability of the Trust 
to  utilise  the  gifts  and  advances  to  expand  its  asset  base  and  to  fund  the 
activities of entities such as Kaimai Development.   
[148] In response, Mr Carruthers pointed to the Judge's finding that:                                                  125  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [70]â€“[71]. 126  At [71]. 127  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [144]. 128  At [149]. 129  Footnotes omitted.   [70] ... There is no evidence of relationship property having 
been  disposed  of  to this Trust.    In  terms  of  s  44,  whilst  there 
has been a disposition of $81,000 by Mr Clayton to this Trust 
by way of gifting, I do not find that there was any intention to 
defeat  Mrs  Clayton's  interest.    She  is  a  discretionary 
beneficiary. 
Mr Carruthers also pointed out that there is no power in s 44C to compensate 
out of the capital of a trust and argued that, in any event, the Court ought to 
exercise its discretion against making an order having regard to the factors in 
s 44C(4). 
[149] Section  44C  can  be  invoked  only  if  there  has  been  a  disposition  of 
relationship property.  Judge Munro's finding that there is  no  evidence  of 
relationship  property  having  been  disposed  of  is  fatal  to  the  claim  under 
s 44C. The appeal 
[156] Mrs  Clayton  appeals  against  the  findings  of  the  Courts  below  in  respect  of 
her claim under s 44C of the PRA. 
[157] In respect of the claim under s 44C, Lady Chambers submits: 
(a) The  evidence  establishes  that  there  were  two  separate  dispositions  of 
relationship property to the Claymark Trust:  
ï‚· Interest free loans by Mr Clayton to the trustees; and  
ï‚· Distributions from the VRPT. 
(b) If the finding that the VRPT is illusory and not a trust at all, but in fact 
property owned by Mr Clayton, is upheld, then the distributions from 
the  VRPT  were  in  fact  dispositions  of  relationship  property  to  the 
trustees of the Claymark Trust. 
(c) The dispositions had the effect of defeating Mrs Clayton's relationship 
property rights because but for the disposition she would have shared 
in   a   larger   pool   of   relationship   property   and,   because   of   the 
disposition,  Mrs  Clayton's  rights  are  detrimentally  affected  as 
compared to Mr Clayton's.  Mr Clayton  remains  in  control  of  the   Claymark  Trust  and  continues  to  benefit  from  the  disposition  of 
relationship property. 
(d) An appropriate order in this case is to compensate Mrs Clayton from 
Mr Clayton's share of relationship property for an amount equivalent 
to half of the net equity of the Claymark Trust. 
[158] In respect of the s 44C claim Mr Carruthers submits that there are concurrent 
findings  that  there  was  no  disposition  of  relationship  property,  but  in  any  event  the 
Court ought to exercise its discretion against making an order considering the factors 
listed in s 44C(4). 
[159] The first question relating to the Trust is whether Mrs Clayton is entitled to a 
compensation  order  under  s  44C  of  the  PRA  in  relation  to  dispositions  made  to  the 
Claymark Trust. 
Discussion 
[160] Like s 44, a successful claim under s 44C requires a "disposition", but, unlike 
s 44, under s 44C the disposition to the trust must also be of "relationship property" 
and have "the effect of defeating" the claim of one of the spouses.  This Court has 
recently  granted  leave  to  appeal  questions  of  whether  relief  can  be  granted  under 
both ss 44 and 44C and if relief can be granted under s 44C where s 44(1) applies.130 
[161] Here there are two different dispositions to the Claymark Trust to consider: 
(a) the three gifts or distributions from the VRPT totalling $81,000; and  
(b) the personal interest free loans made by Mr Clayton totalling $60,365. 
[162] We do not accept Lady Chambers' submission that the distributions from the 
VRPT  were  dispositions  of  relationship  property.    We  have already  held  that  the 
VRPT  was  a  valid  trust.    Its  assets  were  therefore  not  relationship  property.    Our 
                                                 130  Simon v Wright [2014] NZCA 199 at [29].  See also R v G [Lottery winnings] [2011] NZCA 459, 
[2011] NZFLR 1040; and Jessica Palmer and Nicola Peart "Trust principles overlooked" [2011] 
NZLJ 423 at 426.   decision that Mr Clayton's right to exercise his general power of appointment under 
cl 7.1 of the VRPT deed was "relationship property" does not have the  effect  of 
setting  aside  the  trust  or  making  its  assets  relationship  property.    It  is  the  value  of 
Mr Clayton's property right under cl 7.1 which, as a result of the extended definition 
of "property" under the PRA, is within the "relationship property" pool.131 
[163] While we accept that the interest free loans made by Mr Clayton to the trust 
during the marriage were probably made from relationship property, they  remain as 
assets  in  his  hands  and  divisible  as  relationship  property.    We  therefore  do  not 
consider that the loans warrant an order for compensation under s 44C. 
[164] For  these  reasons  we  do  not  accept  Lady  Chambers'  submission  that the 
High Court erred in declining to make an order for compensation under s 44C. 
(b) Claim under s 182 of the FPA [165] Section 182 of the FPA provides: 
182 Court may make orders as to settled property, etc 
(1) On, or within a reasonable time  after, the  making of an  order under 
Part  4 of  this Act  or  a  final  decree  under  Part  2  or  Part  4  of  the 
Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1963, a Family Court may inquire into 
the  existence  of  any  agreement  between  the  parties  to  the  marriage 
or  civil  union  for  the  payment  of  maintenance  or  relating  to  the 
property of the parties or either of them, or any ante-nuptial or post-
nuptial  settlement  made  on  the  parties,  and  may  make  such  orders 
with  reference  to  the  application  of  the  whole  or  any  part  of  any 
property settled or the variation of the terms  of any such agreement 
or settlement, either for the benefit of the children of the marriage or 
civil union or of the parties to the marriage or civil union or either of 
them, as the court thinks fit. 
(2) Where  an  order  under Part  4 of  this  Act,  or  a  final  decree  under 
Part 2 or Part 4 of the  Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1963, has been 
made and the parties have entered into an agreement for the payment 
of maintenance, a Family Court may at any time, on the application 
of either party or of the personal representative of the party liable for 
the  payments  under  the  agreement, cancel or  vary  the  agreement  or 
remit any arrears due under the agreement. 
(3) In the exercise of its discretion under this section, the court may take 
into account the circumstances of the parties and any change in those                                                  131  Above at [114].   circumstances since the date of the agreement or settlement and any 
other matters which the court considers relevant. 
(4) The  court  may exercise  the  powers  conferred  by  this  section, 
notwithstanding  that  there  are  no  children  of  the  marriage  or  civil 
union. 
(5) An order made under this section may from time to time be reviewed 
by the court on the application of either party to the marriage or civil 
union or of either party's personal representative. 
(6) Notwithstanding  subsections  (1)  to  (5),  the  court  shall  not  exercise 
its powers  under this section so as to defeat or vary any agreement, 
entered  into  under Part  6 of  the  Property  (Relationships) Act  1976, 
between the  parties to the marriage  or civil union unless  it is  of the 
opinion that the interests of any child of the marriage or civil union 
so require. The Family Court findings 
[166] In the Family Court Judge Munro rejected Mrs Clayton's claim for provision 
from  the  assets  of  the  Trust  or  a  variation  of  that  Trust  under  s  182  of  the  FPA.132  
She  said  the Trust  was  not  set  up  to  provide  for  Mr  and  Mrs  Clayton  in  the  future; 
indeed, at the time it was established the parties were well aware there was an ante-
nuptial agreement in place which specifically excluded Mrs Clayton from sharing in 
any of Mr Clayton's business interests.  The Judge found Mrs Clayton could not, 
therefore, have had a reasonable expectation of a share in the property purchased by 
the Claymark Trust.  She found that Mrs Clayton's claim in relation to the Claymark 
Trust was limited to a share in any debt owed by the Claymark Trust to Mr Clayton 
or to any entities which comprised property in the hands of Mr Clayton.133 
The High Court findings 
[167] In  the  High  Court  Rodney  Hansen  J  upheld  the  Family  Court  decision.134  
The Judge first noted:135 [138] The  scope  and  purpose  of  s  182  was  discussed [by  the  Supreme 
Court] in Ward  v  Ward.    In  tracing  the  legislative  history  of  the  section  the 
Court  noted  that  ante  and  post-nuptial  settlements  envisaged  and  were 
premised  on  the  continuance  of  the marriage.    If  that  premise  ceased  to 
apply,  a  fundamental  change  in  circumstances  came  about  which  it  was                                                  132  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [68]â€“[71]. 133  At [71]. 134  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [137]â€“[143]. 135  Footnotes omitted.   recognised  could  give  rise  to  an  injustice.    Section  182  sought  to  remedy 
such  injustice  by  giving  the  Court  the  power  to  review  the  settlement  on 
dissolution of the marriage.  The Court went on to say: 
...  As  already  mentioned,  a  nuptial  settlement,  whether  it  be 
ante  or  post-nuptial,  is  premised  on  the  continuation  of  the 
marriage.  When the Court is addressing an application under 
s 182, it must assess whether an order is necessary and, if so, 
in what terms, to reflect the fact that this fundamental premise 
no  longer  applies.    The  expectations  of  the  parties  when  the 
settlement was made may often have been defeated, at least in 
part, by the dissolution of their marriage.  One of the purposes 
of s 182 is to prevent one party from benefitting unfairly from 
the  settlement  at  the  expense  of  the  other  in  the  changed 
circumstances.  In that situation the order should be directed at 
eliminating the unfair benefit.  In Chrystall, Judge Inglis, who 
had  considerable  expertise  in  this  field,  placed  substantial 
emphasis  on  the  role  of  reasonable  expectations  in  the  s  182 
assessment. [168] The Judge then noted that the judgment in Ward v Ward offered guidance on 
the approach to be taken under s 182 in the following passage:136 [25] Based  on  the  foregoing  discussion  we  consider  the  proper  way  to 
address  whether  an  order  should  be  made  under  s  182  is  to  identify  all 
relevant expectations which the parties, and in particular the applicant party, 
had  of  the  settlement  at  the  time  it  was  made.    Those  expectations  should 
then  be  compared  with  the  expectations  which  the  parties,  and  in  particular 
the  applicant  party,  have  of  the  settlement  in  the  changed  circumstances 
brought  about by the dissolution.  The court's task is to assess how best in 
the  changed  circumstances  the  reasonable  expectations  the  applicant had  of 
the settlement should now be fulfilled.  If the dissolution has not affected the 
implementation of the applicant's previous expectations, there will be no call 
for an order. 
[26] Section 182(3) makes this point by directing the court's attention to 
the circumstances of the parties.  By its reference to change of circumstances 
the subsection envisages that the parties' circumstances,  both as regards the 
settlement, and generally, are to be compared with their circumstances at the 
date of the settlement.  The court is also empowered by subs (3) to take into 
account any other matters it considers relevant.  Among those matters it may, 
as  here,  be  significant  who  established  the  settlement  trust  and,  subject  to 
subs (6), the source and character of the assets which have been vested in the 
trust.  Obviously the terms of the settlement will be relevant, as will how the 
trustees are exercising, or are likely to exercise, their powers in the changed 
circumstances.  Also relevant, of course, are the interests of any children or 
other beneficiaries involved.  It is neither necessary nor desirable to attempt 
any  comprehensive  list  of relevant  circumstances  because  each  case  will 
require  individual  consideration.    No  formulaic  or  presumptive  approach 
should be taken.                                                  136  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [139]; Ward v Ward, above n 88.   [27] It  can  therefore  be  seen  that  s  182  applies  if  the  applicant's 
expectations  of  the  ante  or  post-nuptial  settlement  have  been  wholly  or 
partially defeated by the dissolution of the marriage.  The relief to which the 
applicant  is  entitled  in  those  circumstances  is  an  order  in  terms  of  the 
section, in whatever form is best suited to the circumstances, restoring those 
defeated expectations.  The parties should be restored to an appropriate way 
to  the  position  they  were  in,  as  regards  the  settlement,  immediately  after  it 
was made, not immediately before it was made. [169] The Judge then considered the submissions for Mrs Clayton: [140] Ms  Hunter  said that  in  deciding  that  s  182  did  not apply,  the  Judge 
focused  too  heavily  on  the  business  operation  of  the  Trust.    She  said  the 
purpose of the Trust from "an operational point of view" became a dominant 
consideration when the  key consideration was  the  duty of the Trust to meet 
the expectations of the settlement and beneficiaries.  She said the purpose of 
the  Trust  itself  is  to  be  distinguished  from  the  purpose  of  its  acquisitions.  
Ms Hunter submitted that, in any event, the Judge's finding that the purpose 
of  the Trust  was  to  create  a  buffer  was  not  strictly  correct  as  that  land  was 
not purchased until 2000.  She acknowledged that the fact that the Trust was 
primarily established for business purposes should not affect the exercise of 
the s  182  jurisdiction  although  it  may  affect  quantum.    If  the  Judge's 
approach  were  correct,  she  said,  it  would  mean  that  only  settlements  of 
domestic assets would qualify for consideration under s 182. 
[141] Ms Hunter was also concerned that the Judge appeared to have been 
influenced by Mrs Clayton's lack of knowledge of the Trust.  She said that 
introduced a subjective element whereas the test is an objective one, directed 
to the expectation of the beneficiaries. [170] The Judge concluded: [142] It  is  clear  from the  discussion  in Ward,  however,  that  all  aspects  of 
the expectations of the parties at the time of settlement must be considered.  
They  will  not  be  confined  to  expectations  which  may  be  gleaned  from  the 
terms  of  the  settlement  itself.    All  relevant  circumstances,  including  the 
knowledge and intentions of the parties, should be considered.  
[143] Having regard to such circumstances, I see no reason to differ from 
the Judge's assessment of the expectations of the parties at the time the Trust 
was  set  up.    It was  undoubtedly  formed  for  business  purposes,  the  primary 
objective at the time, as Mr Cheshire put it, being to keep "assets out of the 
circle of bank guarantees".  It achieved the secondary purpose of providing a 
buffer  zone  for  resource  consent  purposes.    It  had  all  the  hallmarks  of  a 
conventional family trust.  There is nothing to indicate that it was perceived 
as a means by which Mrs Clayton would acquire an interest or expectation in 
business  assets.    On the  contrary,  as  the  Judge  pointed  out,  the  ante-nuptial 
agreement, entered into a relatively short time before, excluded her from any 
claim to business assets.  There is no basis for a finding that the dissolution 
of the  marriage  affected Mrs Clayton's expectations  when the Trust was 
formed.   The appeal 
[171] Mrs  Clayton  appeals  against  the  findings  of  the  Courts  below  in  respect  of 
her claim under s 182 of the FPA. 
[172] Lady  Chambers  submits  first  that  the  Claymark  Trust  was  a  "nuptial 
settlement" within the meaning of s 182, engaging the court's discretion because: 137 
(a) It was settled during the marriage. 
(b) It  made  continuing  provision  for  at  least  one  of  the  parties  to  the 
marriage  in  the  capacity  as  spouses  (in  fact  both)  as  is  shown  by  the 
descriptions of Mrs Clayton in the trust deed as (depending on future 
circumstances) "the wife of the settlor" and "any former wife of the 
settlor" and "the widow of the settlor".  
(c) The   Trust   also   existed   for   the   benefit   of   the   children   and 
grandchildren of the parties. 
(d) There is no authority that the nature of the assets owned by a trust has 
any  bearing  on  whether  a  settlement  is  nuptial  or  not  (that  is,  a 
settlement  may  be  a  nuptial  one  even  if  it  establishes  a  "business 
trust"  if  it  benefits  one  or  both  of  the  spouses).  Adopting  that 
approach  would  mean  s 182  would  be  limited  to  domestic  assets  and 
that cannot have been intended by Parliament.  A finding that the Trust 
was  a  nuptial  settlement  is  consistent  with  the  purpose  of  s  182  of 
enabling  resort  by  the  courts  to  trust  assets  or  to  modify  a  trust  in 
response to the changed circumstances of a divorce.   
(e) In  any  event  the  Family  Court  and  High  Court  were  wrong  to 
conclude  that  the  Trust  was  settled  for  a  business  purpose  on  the 
evidence.    It  was  not  set  up  to  purchase the  properties  bordering  the 
                                                 137  Citing Ward v Ward, above n 88; Kidd v van den Brink [2010] NZCA 169; Kennon v Spry, above 
n 108; Brooks v Brooks [1996] AC 375 (HL) at 391; and Lort-Williams v Lort-Williams [1951] P 
395 (CA) at 403 per Denning LJ.   sawmill as is evidenced by the fact that these were not purchased until 
2000, six years after the trust was settled.  Further, it has owned trust 
assets,  including  Mrs  Clayton's  personal  vehicle,  the  parties'  first 
home and an apartment in Auckland used by the  parties, for personal 
enjoyment as well as for business. 
(f) There  was  no  suggestion  or  evidence  in  the  lower  Courts  as  to  what 
persons,  if  not  Mr  and  Mrs  Clayton  and  their  children,  the Trust  was 
set up to benefit.  
(g) There   is no   valid   conceptual   distinction   between   productive   or 
business assets owned personally or by other means, or by a trust.  In 
any case, the choice of vehicle should not mean that the assets should 
not  be  treated  as  having  been  subject  to  a  nuptial  settlement  if  the 
settlement  was  intended  to  provide  ongoing  benefit  to  one  of  the 
spouses.  As the High Court noted, the Trust "had all the hallmarks of 
a conventional family trust".138 
(h) Arguably,  rather  than  detracting  from  the  nuptial  character  of  the 
business   settlement   the   accepted   evidence   of   Mr Cheshire   and 
Mr Clayton that the Trust was formed to "keep 'assets out of the circle 
of bank guarantees'" in order to protect the beneficiaries, including 
Mrs Clayton, rather than to disenfranchise her.139   
[173] Lady  Chambers  then  submits  that  the discretion  under  s 182  should  be 
exercised in the present case because: 
(a) The  purpose  of  the  provision  is  to  empower  courts  to  make  good  the 
applicant's reasonable expectations if those differ from the parties' 
changed  expectations  in  light  of  all  the  relevant  circumstances  since 
the date of settlement.140 
                                                 138  At [143]. 139  At [143]. 140  Ward v Ward, above n 88, at [25].   (b) The  unchallenged  evidence  of  Mrs  Clayton  at  the  time  the Trust  was 
set up was that she  expected to  remain married to Mr Clayton and to 
"benefit equally from the accumulated wealth". 
(c) It  does  not  follow that  because  Mr  Clayton  excluded  Mrs Clayton 
from control of the Trust, in accordance with a general attitude that he 
wanted  to  be  in  control  of  financial  and  family,  that  he  intended  to 
exclude Mrs Clayton from benefitting from the assets. 
(d) The existence of the ante-nuptial agreement does not 
mean Mr Clayton did not settle a trust for his wife's benefit five years 
later when he settled the Trust and expected she would benefit.  There 
was    no    contemporaneous    evidence    that    Mr Clayton    intended 
Mrs Clayton  not  to  benefit  as  a  result  of  the  ante-nuptial  agreement.  
To the contrary, he included her as a beneficiary, indicating she would 
acquire an interest or expectation in the business assets.   
(e) Any   relevance   of   the   ante-nuptial   agreement   was   in   any event 
lessened because it was silent as to property not (beneficially) owned 
by Mr and Mrs Clayton personally. 
(f) Any   distribution   post-dissolution  in  Mrs  Clayton's  favour  was 
unlikely.  
(g) The  Trust  was  settled  by  Mr  Clayton  on  himself,  his  wife  and  his 
family for  their  benefit  using  assets  derived  from  the  joint  efforts  of 
the  parties  in  the  Claymark  business.    Mrs Clayton  made  the  efforts 
she  did  on  the  understanding  that  she  expected  to  benefit  as  wife 
through the future.  
[174] Finally, Lady Chambers submitted it was appropriate that Mrs Clayton be put 
in the position she was initially after settlement.  This should be done by vesting half 
of the Trust's assets in Mrs Clayton on trust for herself, the parties' children and 
grandchildren.   [175] In respect of the s 182 claim Mr Carruthers submits: 
(a) The Claymark Trust is not a family trust.   It is not directed primarily 
towards  providing  for  the  Clayton  family  unit.    It  was  not  settled  on 
the premise that the marriage would continue. 
(b) The  property  acquired  by  the  Trust  consists  of  commercial  assets 
acquired  by  third  parties  in  arm's  length  transactions,  funded  by 
mortgage advances and from the VRPT which was the only trust with 
a bank facility.  Mrs Clayton did not contribute to the Trust.  
(c) Mr and Mrs Clayton were not "principal beneficiaries" of the Trust, 
since they were not the final beneficiaries. 
(d) The PRA's principles of equal division of relationship property do not 
underpin  s  182.    Its  purpose  is  to  restore  the  reasonable  expectations 
of  an  applicant  whose  reasonable  expectations  to  benefit  from  a 
settlement cease because of the dissolution of a marriage. 
(e) The  onus  is  on  the  applicant  to  show  why  the  settlement  should  be 
departed  from,  and  it  should  be  departed  from  only  to  the  extent 
shown to be necessary.  
(f) The existence of beneficiaries other than Mr and Mrs Clayton tends to 
support that the settlement was not a "nuptial settlement". 
(g) The   ante-nuptial   agreement   is   in   any   event   determinative   that 
Mrs Clayton could not have an expectation to benefit from the Trust. 
Discussion 
[176] The  summary  of  the  relevant  law  in  the  High  Court  judgment  was  not 
challenged.  A successful claim under s 182 requires that "any agreement" or "any 
ante-nuptial  or  post-nuptial settlement" relating to the property must be shown to 
exist  between  the  former spouses.    The  court  is  empowered  to  make  any  order  it   thinks fit for the benefit of the parties or their children.  In exercising that power the 
court  will  have  regard  to  any  change  in  the  circumstances  of  the  parties  since  the 
date of the agreement or settlement and any other matters which the court considers 
relevant.    This  general  power  has  been  subject  to  several  decisions  explaining  its 
application, most notably by the Supreme Court in Ward v Ward.141 
[177] We do not accept Lady Chambers' submissions that the Courts below erred in 
deciding that the Claymark Trust was not a "nuptial settlement" and that therefore no 
order for provision should be made or for variation of the Trust under s 182.  Again 
our reasons may be stated shortly: 
(a) As the Supreme Court held in Ward  v  Ward, the  focus under s 182 is 
on the expectations of the parties, especially the applicant, at the time 
of the settlement.142  Those expectations are to be ascertained from all 
relevant evidence, not just the terms of the settlement itself. 
(b) Here  both  Courts  below  found  that  the  expectations  of  Mr  and 
Mrs Clayton  when  the  Trust  was  established  were  that  it  was  formed 
for  business  purposes  and  not  as  a  means  by  which  Mrs  Clayton 
would  acquire  an  interest  or  expectation  in  business  assets.    The 
problem for  Mrs  Clayton  is  not  the  characterisation  of  the  trust,  but 
that there are concurrent findings of fact that Mr and Mrs Clayton did 
not have the necessary expectations. 
(c) Both  Courts  below  also  held  that  there  was  no  basis  for  finding  that 
the dissolution of the marriage affected Mrs Clayton's expectations. 
(d) We  were  not  persuaded  by  Lady  Chambers  that  there  was  any  good 
basis  for  us  to  depart  from  the  findings  in  the  Courts  below  on  this 
issue.  In particular, the fact that the properties bordering the sawmill 
were  not  purchased  until  some  years  after  the  Trust  was  settled  does 
not mean that the parties' expectations were otherwise than as found 
                                                 141  Ward  v  Ward,  above  n 88;  see  generally Family  Procedure (online  looseleaf  ed,  Thomson 
Reuters) at [FP182.01]â€“[FP182.08]. 142  Ward v Ward, above n 88, at [25]â€“[27].   by the Courts below. 
The answers to the questions 
[178] Accordingly, we answer the two questions as follows: (a) Is Mrs Clayton entitled to a compensation order under s 44C of the PRA 
in relation to dispositions made to the Claymark Trust? 
Answer:   No. 
(b)  Is  Mrs  Clayton  entitled  to  provision  from  the  assets  of  the  Claymark 
Trust or to a variation of that trust, applying s 182 of the FPA? 
Answer:   No. The Post-Separation Trusts 
The four trusts 
[179] The  four  trusts  settled  by  Mr  Clayton  after  he  and  Mrs  Clayton  separated 
were: 
(a) The Denarau Resort Trust;  
(b) The Sophia No 7 Trust;  
(c) The Chelmsford Trust; and 
(d) The Lighter Quay 5B Trust. 
Mrs Clayton's claims 
[180] Mrs Clayton claims that she is entitled to a half share in the current equity of 
the properties owned by the four trusts.  Her claim is based on s 44 of the PRA which 
we  have  already  set  out  and  explained.143  It  will  be  recalled that  under  s  44  the 
Court must be satisfied that there has been a disposition of property made in order to 
                                                 143  Above at [126] and [133]â€“[134].   defeat  the  claim  or  rights  of  any  person  under  the  PRA.    Unlike  the  position  under 
s 44C, the property under s 44 need not be relationship property.144 
A preliminary point 
[181] Mrs  Clayton's  claims  in  respect  of  these  post-separation  trusts  were  not 
straightforward  because  of  difficulties  she  encountered  in  obtaining  the  relevant 
information  relating  to  the  trusts  and  Mr  Clayton's  dispositions  of  relationship 
property  to  them.    It  was  necessary  for  her  to  seek  an  order  against  Mr  Clayton 
(under r 398 of the Family Courts Rules 2002) requiring him to disclose the relevant 
information  by  appearing  for  examination  or  filing  an  adequate  narrative  affidavit.  
Orders  to  that  effect  were  made  in  the  Family  Court.145  But  difficulties  were  still 
encountered by Mrs Clayton in respect of the evidence for these claims. 
[182] In light of these difficulties, Lady Chambers invited us to adopt the approach 
of  the  United  Kingdom  Supreme  Court  in Prest  v  Petrodel  Resources  Ltd where  it 
was suggested that in relationship property proceedings of this nature courts should 
adopt a broader approach than usual to the drawing of inferences adverse to a party 
who fails to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information.146 
[183] Lord Sumption, delivering the leading judgment, put it this way:147 ... although  technically  a  claimant,  the  wife  is  in  reality  dependent  on  the 
disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper 
claim.  The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the 
main  factors  inhibiting  the  drawing  of  adverse  inferences  from  the  absence 
of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings 
of  this  kind  as  it  is  in  ordinary  litigation.  These  considerations  are  not  a 
licence  to   engage   in   pure   speculation.  But  judges   exercising   family 
jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the 
inherent  improbabilities  when  deciding  what  an  uncommunicative  husband 
is likely to be concealing. [184] Baroness Hale and Lord Wilson in their joint judgment said:148 
                                                 144  Above at [160]. 145  MAC v MAC FC Rotorua FAM-2007-063-652, 2 July 2008, aff'd C v C [Costs] [2009] NZFLR 
322 (HC), leave to appeal refused C v C HC Auckland CIV-2008-404-4864, 7 April 2009, aff'd 
[2009] NZCA 319. 146  Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34, [2013] 2 AC 467. 147  At [45]. 148  At [85].   There  is  a  public  interest  in  spouses  making  proper  provision  for  one 
another,  both  during  and  after  their  marriage,  in  particular  when  there  are 
children  to  be  cared  for  and  educated,  but  also  for  all  the  other  reasons 
explored  in  cases  such  as McFarlane  v  McFarlane [[2006]  UKHL  24] 
[2006] 2 AC 618.  This means that the court's role is an inquisitorial one.  It 
also  means  that  the  parties  have  a  duty,  not  only  to  one  another  but  also  to 
the  court,  to  make  full and  frank  disclosure  of  all  the  material  facts ... .  If 
they  do  not  do  so,  the  court  is  entitled  to  draw  such  inferences  as  can 
properly  be  drawn  from  all  the  available  material,  including  what  has  been 
disclosed, judicial experience of what is likely to be being concealed and the 
inherent probabilities, in deciding what the facts are. [185] Somewhat  similar  views  about  the  need  for  parties  in  relationship  property 
proceedings to make proper disclosure and the inappropriateness of adopting a strict 
approach  to  the  question  of  onus  of  proof  were  expressed  by  Robertson  J  in  this 
Court in M v B.149 
[186] In our view, when the public interest considerations lying behind the purpose 
and principles of the PRA are taken into account, there is merit in  an  approach that 
recognises that: 
(a) parties to relationship property proceedings are under an obligation to 
make  full  and  frank  disclosure  of  all  relevant  information  in  order  to 
ensure that the court is in a position to make appropriate orders for the 
ascertainment and division of relationship property under the PRA; 
(b) if  a  party  who  had  or  has  relevant  information  available  for  that 
purpose  fails  to  disclose  it  in the  proceedings,  the  court  may  draw 
such  inferences  as  it  considers  appropriate,  including  the  adverse 
inference  that  the  information  would  not  have  assisted  that  party  if  it 
had been disclosed;150 and 
(c) in drawing  appropriate inferences for the purpose of making  findings 
of  fact,  the  court  may  rely  on  all  the  information  that  has  been 
                                                 149  M v B, above n 113, at [50]. 150  Cf Jones  v  Dunkel (1959)  101  CLR  298  at  308,  312  and  320â€“321; Ithaca  (Custodians)  Ltd v

to appeal refused Morgenstern v Jeffreys [2014] NZSC 176.   disclosed,  its  experience  in  cases  of  this  nature  and  the  inherent 
probabilities from the non-disclosure of information. 
[187] In  the  absence  of  any  submissions  to  the  contrary  for  Mr Clayton  or  the 
various trustees, we propose to follow this approach in this case. 
(a) The Denarau Resort Trust 
[188] The Denarau Resort Trust was established in 2007 for the purpose of holding 
an investment in two apartments in the Denarau Resort in Fiji.  Mr Clayton agreed to 
purchase the apartments "off the plans" in 2005 before the parties separated.  By the 
time the purchase was completed, they were apart. 
[189] The  trustee  is  McGloskey  Nominees  Ltd.    The  final  beneficiaries  are  the 
children   and   grandchildren   of   the   parties   living   at   the   date   of   distribution.  
Mr Clayton is a discretionary beneficiary.  Mrs Clayton is not a beneficiary. 
[190] According  to  Mr  Giesbers,  the  accountant  chairman  of  the  Claymark  group, 
the total cost of the apartments was $706,563 and the accounts showed advances to 
the  Trust  of  $583,887  by  the  Colonial  National  Bank,  Fiji  and,  by  the  VRPT,  of 
$277,499, leaving negative equity of $154,823. 
[191] The judgments below confirm that the purchase was funded in part by a loan 
from  a  Fiji  bank  and  in  part  by what is described as "an advance from a former 
property trust".151  Mr Clayton's evidence was that the balance of the deposit came 
from  the  proceeds  of  sale  of  the  Lake  Rotoiti  property.    He  said  the  balance  of  the 
purchase price came from the bank loan. 
The Family Court decision 
[192] In the Family Court Judge Munro upheld Mrs Clayton's claim.  The Judge 
said: [99] Property acquired  after separation is  prima  facie  separate  property so 
that any interest that Mr Clayton has in the Denarau Resort Trust would be his                                                  151  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [97]; High Court judgment, above n 1, at [105].   separate property.  However, s 44 includes any disposition of property during 
the  marriage.    Whilst  the  parties  separated  at  the  end  of  2006,  the  marriage 
was not dissolved until 2009.  Mr Clayton disposed of property to the Denarau 
Resort Trust by way of payment of a deposit and by way of the advance from 
the  Vaughan  Road  Property  Trust.    This  disposition  has  had  the  effect  of 
defeating  Mrs  Clayton's  interest,  again,  given  that  she  has  no  beneficial 
interest in the Trust.  Accordingly, Mrs Clayton is entitled to a half share in the 
equity in these apartments. The High Court decision 
[193] In the High Court Rodney Hansen J allowed the appeal by Mr Clayton.  The 
Judge said: [109] I  find  it  impossible  on  the  basis  of  the  Judge's  decision,  the 
submissions of counsel and the evidence to which I have referred, to obtain a 
clear  picture  of  how  the  purchase  was  funded.    No  accounts  for  the  Trust 
were produced.  As far as I am aware, there is no evidence of the amount of 
the  deposit  paid  from  the  proceeds  of  sale  of  the  Rotoiti  property  (or  what 
those proceeds amounted to and how the balance of them was disposed of).  
Furthermore,  on  the  information  available,  the  borrowings  of  the  Trust 
exceed  the  value  of  assets.   The  order  made  by  the  Judge  that  Mrs  Clayton 
share  equally in the  net assets  of  the Trust  may  not  be  an  effective  remedy.  
The better course may have been to order under s 44(2)(b) that the Trust pay 
to Mrs Clayton one half of the amount contributed to the purchase from the 
proceeds of sale of the Rotoiti property.   
[110] I am left in doubt whether there are grounds for an order under s 44 
and,   if   there   are,   that   the   order   made   is   the   right   remedy.      In   the 
circumstances,  I  propose  to  allow  the  appeal  against  this  aspect  of  the 
judgment and to refer the issue back to the Family Court for further evidence 
to be adduced and the question of remedy reconsidered. The appeal 
[194] Mrs  Clayton  seeks  to  have  the  judgment  of  the  Family  Court  reinstated  in 
respect  of  the  Denarau  Resort  Trust.    Lady  Chambers  submits  that  the  evidence  of 
Mr  Clayton  clearly  established  that  he  entered  into  the  agreement  for  sale  and 
purchase  of  the  apartments  in  Fiji  before  the  parties  separated,  he  lent  the  Trust 
$200,000 for the deposit and the purchase was funded by part of the net proceeds of 
the sale  of  the  Lake  Rotoiti  property  and  a  loan  from  the  Colonial  National  Bank.  
On  the  basis  of  this  evidence,  Lady  Chambers  submits  that,  as  the  Family  Court 
Judge  held,  the  payment  of  the  deposit  was  a  disposition  caught  by  s  44  because 
Mrs Clayton was not a beneficiary of the Trust.   [195] The trustees now accept that the agreement for sale and purchase was entered 
into  before  the  parties  separated  and  the  issue  should  be  referred  back  to  the 
High Court. 
Discussion 
[196] We agree with the Family Court Judge that Mrs Clayton's claim under s 44 is 
made out in respect of this Trust, especially in light of Mr Clayton's evidence that he 
lent the Trust $200,000 for the deposit.  The High Court Judge's suggestion that there 
was no evidence about the amount of the deposit is not correct. 
[197]   We  note  that  the  Family  Court  Judge  appears  to  refer  to  the  effect  of  the 
disposition  rather  than  it  being  made  in  order  to  defeat  Mrs Clayton's claim as is 
required under s 44.  However, in the absence of evidence that the deposit came from 
separate  property  and  given  that  Mrs Clayton  is  not  a  beneficiary  of  the  Trust,  the 
inference is available that s 44 applies. 
[198] Mr Clayton's suggestion that there was a subsequent agreement relating to 
the purchase of the apartments was not supported by any evidence.  Bearing in mind 
the  obligation  on  Mr  Clayton  to  disclose  all  the  relevant  evidence  relating  to  the 
purchase  of  the  apartments,  we  are  not  prepared  to  accept  this  suggestion  in  the 
absence  of  any  evidence  to  support  it.    For  the  reasons  already  given,  we  are 
prepared to draw the inference that no such evidence was available.152 
[199] We therefore uphold the outcome of the Family Court decision. 
(b) The Sophia No 7 Trust 
[200] The  Sophia  No  7  Trust  was  established  on  2  September  2008  to  hold  a 
property  in  Rotorua.    The  settlor  was  Mr  Perry,  a  solicitor.    The  sole  trustee  is 
Deborah Vaughan, Mr Clayton's sister.  The beneficiaries are Deborah Vaughan, her 
children and any relative of hers, including Mr Clayton. 
                                                 152  Above at [181]â€“[187].   [201] Mr  Clayton  was  the  successful  bidder  at  an  auction  of the  trust  property, 
which  is  a  residential  property  in  Rotorua.    He  signed  the  sale  and  purchase 
agreement   and   paid   the   deposit.     A   deed   of   nomination   was   then   executed 
contemporaneously  with  the  signing  of  the  Sophia  No  7  Trust  deed  nominating  the 
trustee to purchase the property.   
[202] Ms Vaughan said she did not recall signing any  documents in relation to  the 
Trust, although she conceded that she may have.   She became aware that  she was a 
trustee  only  when  she  received  the  rates  demand  for  the  property.    She  regards  her 
brother as the owner of the property.  She knows nothing about the way in which the 
property was purchased and has made no decisions in relation to the property or the 
Trust.  Mr Clayton was unable to explain why the Trust was set up for the benefit of 
his sister and her children. 
The Family Court decision 
[203] In  the  Family  Court  Judge  Munro  found  the  purchase  price  of  the  property 
was  $277,000.153  She noted Mr Clayton's evidence that $140,000 of the purchase 
price  was  advanced  from  the  VRPT.    On  the  basis  that  the  deed  of  nomination 
amounted to  a disposition in terms of Re Polkinghorne Trust she held that the deed 
of nomination was a clear attempt to defeat Mrs Clayton's interest in the funds used 
to  purchase  the  property.154  She  concluded  that  Mrs Clayton  was  entitled  to  a  one 
half share in the equity in the property. 
The High Court decision 
[204] In the High Court Rodney Hansen J said: [115] Some  of  the  documents  to  which  I  was  referred  shed  a  little  more 
light  on  the  way  in  which  the  purchase  of  the property  was  funded.  
According  to  the  schedule  prepared  by  Mr  Geisber  [sic],  the  property  was 
bought  for  $320,000  and  funded  as  to  $142,615  by  an  advance  from  the 
Vaughan   Road   Property   Trust   with   Mr Clayton   personally   advancing 
$137,000.  The equity in the Trust is accordingly $40,385.  The advance by 
the  Vaughan  Road  Properties  Trust  is  confirmed  by  enquiries  made  by  a 
chartered  accountant,  Bruce  Warden,  who  said  that  $140,000  with  the 
reference  "BNZ  Term  Loan"  was  deposited  into  the  Vaughan  Road                                                  153  At [105]. 154  At [105]; Re Polkinghorne Trust, above n 121.   Properties Trust  on  2  September  2008  and  transferred  out  on the  same  day.  
The  payment  was  debited  to  the  Denarau  Trust  but  Mr  Warden  says  that 
appears  to  be  a  mistake  as  the  payment  was  made  on  the  day  on  which  the 
purchase of the Sophia Street property settled. 
[116] Mr Carruthers submitted  that the  Family Court erred in finding that 
the deed of nomination was an attempt to defeat Mrs Clayton's interest in the 
funds  used  to  purchase  the  property.    However,  in  the  absence  of  an 
explanation by Mr Clayton, the purchase of the property by a trust ostensibly 
set up to benefit his sister and her family but in reality having no connection 
with  them,  clearly  appears  to  have  had  the  purpose  of  putting  property 
beyond the reach of Mrs Clayton. 
[117] I see  no reason  to disturb the Judge's finding in that regard though, 
once  again,  I  have  reservations  about  the  remedy  she  adopted.    I  consider 
that further enquiry is required to establish the purchase price and the way in 
which  it  was  funded  before  determining  the  value  of  property  which  was 
disposed of and in which Mrs Clayton may be entitled to claim an interest.  I 
propose  to  remit  this  aspect  of  the  case  back  to  the  Family  Court  for 
reconsideration. The appeal 
[205] It  appears  Mr  Carruthers  submits  that  no  order  should  be  made  against  the 
trustees because the source of Mr Clayton's  contribution is not money or assets 
which would otherwise  be relationship property.    In particular he submits that there 
is  no  evidence  of  a  deposit  having  been  paid  from  the  sale  of  the  Lake  Rotoiti 
property. 
[206] Mr  Carruthers  does  not  challenge,  however,  the  finding  in  the  Family  Court 
that  Mr Clayton  intended  to  defeat  Mrs  Clayton's  interest  in  any  relationship 
property.  
[207] Mrs Clayton's position in respect of the Sophia No 7 Trust as well as the 
Chelmsford Trust  and  Lighter Quay 5B Trust is that in the context where  assets are 
acquired  in  the  period  shortly  following  a  separation  and  there  is  no  clear  positive 
evidence  that  separate  property  was  applied  to  acquire  the  property,  as  in  this  case, 
courts  can,  and  this  Court  in  this  case  should,  draw  the  inference  that  the  property 
was acquired using relationship property.  She submits this inference is reinforced by 
Mr Clayton's reluctant, even obstructive attitude to his disclosure obligations in the 
Family Court.    [208] Lady Chambers submits it is improbable Mr Clayton would have been able to 
fund the purchase of the properties from his income of $280,000 which, on his own 
evidence, is substantially spent on maintaining Mrs Clayton and the children.  
Discussion 
[209] We  agree  with  Lady  Chambers  that  the  obligation  was  on  Mr  Clayton  to 
make  full  disclosure  of  the  relevant  information  relating  to  the  purchase  of  the 
property.    His  failure  to  do  so  means  that  an  inference  may  be  drawn  that  if  the 
relevant  information  had  been disclosed  it  would  not  have  supported  his case.    It  is 
therefore not open to Mr Clayton to rely on the  absence of the  relevant evidence to 
avoid an order being made against him under s 44. 
[210] In our view it was open to the Family Court Judge to reach the conclusion she 
did. 
[211] We  also  agree  with  the  High  Court  Judge  that  in  the  absence  of  an 
explanation  from  Mr  Clayton  the  purchase  of  the  property  clearly  appears  to  have 
had  the  purpose  of  putting  property  beyond  the  reach  of  Mrs  Clayton,  thereby 
defeating  her  rights  in  terms  of  s  44.   Again,  for  the  reasons  already  given,  we  are 
prepared to draw the inference adverse to Mr Clayton.155 
[212] We  add  that  our  review  of  the  evidence  of  Ms Vaughan,  Mr Giesbers  and 
Mr Clayton reveals nothing to displace this finding. 
[213] We  therefore  uphold  the  decision  of  the  Family  Court,  but  (as  the  parties 
agree  is  necessary)  remit  the  case  to  the  High  Court  to  calculate  the  quantum  of 
Mrs Clayton's interest. 
(c) The Chelmsford Trust 
[214] The  Chelmsford  Trust  was  established  on  2  June  2009.    The  trustee  is 
Chelmsford Holdings Ltd.  Mr Clayton is the sole beneficiary of the trust and has the 
power to appoint or remove trustees.  The Trust purchased properties at Oasis Place 
                                                 155  Above at [181]â€“[187].   and  Gwendoline  Street,  Rotorua  in  2009.    The  trustee  purchased  the  Oasis  Place 
property pursuant to a deed of nomination which included the following provision:156 COVENANTS: 
1 DECLARATION OF TRUST 
1.1 Trustee holds property.  The Trustee declares that it will hold 
the Trust Property in trust for the Beneficiary. 
1.2 Trustee will transfer property.  At the request and cost of the 
Beneficiary,  the  Trustee  will  transfer  the  Trust  Property,  or 
the  benefit  of  the  Trust  Property,  to  the  Beneficiary  as  and 
when the Beneficiary requires. 
1.3 Trustee  will  deal  with  property  at  request  of  beneficiary.  
Until the Trust Property is transferred to the Beneficiary the 
Trustee  will  deal  with  the Trust  Property  as  the  Beneficiary 
requires. [215] The Oasis Place property is adjacent to the sawmill operation in Rotorua.  It 
was a strategic acquisition for business purposes.  The Gwendoline Street property is 
adjacent to the home of Mr Clayton's mother.  Mr Clayton told the Court that he 
thought  it  would  be  beneficial  to  acquire  the  property  so  that  his  mother  would  be 
able to control who lived next door. 
[216] The Oasis Place property  was purchased for a little over $1,000,000 and  the 
Gwendoline  Street  property  for  about  $400,000.    These  figures  are  taken  from  the 
accounts of the Trust as  at 31 March 2011.  The  Family Court Judge found that the 
purchases  were  funded  by  a  contribution  of  $40,000  by  Mr  Clayton,  an  advance  of 
$370,000  from  the  VRPT  and  a  loan  from  the  BNZ  of  $1,106,000.157  As  Rodney 
Hansen J said, this exceeds the cost of the properties by some $100,000 and may not 
be entirely accurate.158 
[217] The  accounts  of  the  Chelmsford Trust  as  at  31  March  2011  include  the 
following liabilities: 
(a) Mr Clayton  $129,750.  
                                                 156  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [118]. 157  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [111]. 158  At [120].   (b) The VRPT  $222,516.  
(c) Two BNZ mortgages $1,094,500.  
[218] The accounts of the VRPT as at 31 March 2011 include as an asset a loan to 
the Chelmsford Trust of $222,516. 
The Family Court decision 
[219] Judge Munro said: [111] Both  of  these  properties  were  purchased  following  the  sale  of  a 
property  referred  to  as  Panahome,  which  was  owned  by  the  Vaughan  Road 
Property  Trust,  on  31  July  2008.    This  property  was  sold  for  $6,350,000.  
Mr Clayton paid $40,000 toward the purchases, the Vaughan Road Property 
Trust  advanced  $370,000  and  Bank  of  New Zealand  loaned  $1,106,000.  
Mrs Clayton  had  registered  a  s  42  notice  in  relation  to  that  property  and 
agreed to remove that notice to allow the sale to proceed on the giving of an 
assurance  by  Mr  Clayton  that  the  nett [sic] proceeds  of  the  sale  would  be 
used to reduce  debt only, and  that no further monies would be drawn down 
other than in the ordinary course of business.  Mr Clayton in fact drew funds 
down from the BNZ to assist in the purchase of Oasis Place and Gwendoline 
Street,   contrary   to   his   assurance.      He   accepts   that   the   purchase   of 
Gwendoline  Street  could  not  be  considered  to  be  in  the  ordinary  course  of 
business,  but  in  relation  to  the Oasis  Place  purchase,  it  is  his  position  that 
this was an opportunity which was important to take advantage of and would 
be of significant benefit to the business.  It could not be said, however, that 
this purchase was "in the ordinary course of business".    The  effect  of  the 
purchase  of  these  two  properties  through  the  trust  again  has  been  to  place 
funds  held  by  Mr  Clayton and  in  the Vaughan  Road  Property Trust  beyond 
the  reach  of  Mrs  Clayton.    The  reality  of  this  trust  is  that  Mr  Clayton  has 
settled  the  trust  with  advances  by  himself  and  the  Vaughan  Road  Property 
Trust, to the trustee to hold for Mr Clayton at his behest.  The effect has been 
to  disenfranchise  Mrs  Clayton  from  any  entitlement  to  those  funds.    I  find 
that  Mr  Clayton  was  well  aware  of  this  effect.    I  find  that  s  44  applies.  
Mrs Clayton  is  entitled  to  a  one  half  share  in  the  equity  of  both  properties 
held by this Trust. The High Court decision 
[220] Rodney Hansen J said: [122] For  Mr  Clayton,  it  is  said  that  the  Judge  has  not  identified  any 
relationship property having been disposed of to fund the  acquisition of the 
Chelmsford Trust properties.  It has not therefore been shown that there was 
a disposition for the purpose of defeating a claim by Mrs Clayton.  As I have 
already  said,  a  disposition  for the  purpose  of  s  44  may  be  of  any  property.    The  key  issue  is  not  the  status  of  the  property  but  whether  the  disposition 
was made in order to defeat the claim of Mrs Clayton.   
[123] The  most  reliable  guide  to  the  purpose  of  a  course  of  action  is  its 
likely  or  achieved  outcome.    The  Judge  found  the  effect  of  the  transaction 
was to deny Mrs Clayton a claim to the funds disposed of: as the Judge said, 
"to disenfranchise" her.  However, it is by no means clear that this was the 
likely or intended consequence.  There is nothing to show where the $40,000 
came  from  and  that  Mrs  Clayton  would  have  any  right  to  a  claim.   At  the 
time  Mr  Clayton  would  not  have  regarded  Mrs Clayton  as  having  rights  to 
claim against the assets of the Vaughan Road Property Trust. 
[124] On the present state of the evidence, I do not believe an order under 
s 44 is justified.  If it is, I doubt that the order made is an effective remedy.  
If  it  is  not,  the  application  of  s  44C  will  need  to  be  considered.    Further 
evidence  may  be  filed  as  required  by  the  findings  I  have  made  and  for  the 
issues to be reconsidered. The appeal 
[221] Mrs  Clayton  seeks  to  have  the  judgment  of  the  Family  Court  reinstated  in 
respect  of  the  Chelmsford  Trust.    Lady  Chambers  submits  that  s  44  is  applicable 
because: 
(a) the  properties  which  are  the  assets  of  the  trust  were  acquired  from 
Mr Clayton's  property,  namely  advances  from  the  VRPT  and 
Mr Clayton himself;159 
(b) as  he  is  the  sole  beneficiary  of  the Trust,  the  dispositions  were  made 
with the intention to defeat Mrs Clayton's claim to that property; and 
(c) Mr Clayton adduced no evidence to establish that the properties were 
acquired after the separation from his separate property. 
[222] For  the  trustee,  Mr  Carruthers  submits  that  the  High  Court  decision  was 
correct because no property was disposed of to the Chelmsford Trust.  The purchases 
of the two properties were paid for by $40,000 from Mr Clayton personally, a loan of 
$1,090,000 from the BNZ, and $370,000 from the BNZ through the VRPT.160 
                                                 159  Lady  Chambers  QC  points out that the Trust's financial statements of, for example, 31 March 
2010 reflect a loan to Mr Clayton of $149,250.  160  These figures reflect those in the submissions.   Discussion 
[223] We do not agree with Mr Carruthers that there was no disposition of property 
in terms of s 44.  A loan may constitute a disposition of property.161  The loans were 
therefore  capable  of  being  classified  as  dispositions  of  property  under  s  44.    The 
critical  question  is  whether  the  loans  were  made  in order to defeat Mrs Clayton's 
rights under the PRA. 
[224] Clearly  the  BNZ  loan  of  $1,106,000  was  not  made  by  the  BNZ  with  that 
intention.  It was made to the Chelmsford Trust for the purpose of assisting with the 
purchase of the two properties and was secured by way of mortgage. 
[225] In respect of Mr Clayton's personal loan of $40,000 we accept that it was 
open  to  the  Family  Court  Judge  to  find  that  s  44  applied  not  so  much  because  the 
"effect" of the loan was to "disenfranchise" Mrs Clayton (the language of s 44C) but 
because it was made by  Mr Clayton with the intention of defeating her rights under 
the PRA.162  We do not accept the approach of the High Court Judge that it was for 
Mrs Clayton  to  establish  where  the  personal  advance  from  Mr Clayton  came  from.  
For the reasons already set out, given the absence of any further relevant information 
relating  to  the  source  of  the  funds  from  Mr  Clayton,  adverse  inferences  may  be 
drawn  in  respect  of  the  source  and  the  intention  or  purpose  of  the  disposition.   We 
add that, in our view, nothing in the evidence of Mr Cheshire or Mr Giesbers would 
serve to alter this result. 
[226] In  respect  of  the  loan  of  $370,000  from  the  BNZ  through  the  VRPT  there 
were  in  fact  two  loans:  the  first  from  the  BNZ  to  the VRPT,  which  was  secured  by 
way of mortgage over properties owned by the VRPT, and the second by the VRPT 
to the Chelmsford Trust, which was unsecured.  As with the BNZ loan direct to the 
Chelmsford  Trust,  the  first  loan  was  not  made  by  the  BNZ  with  the  proscribed 
intention. 
  
                                                 161  Atkin, above n 121, at [9.43]. 162  SM v ASB Bank Ltd, above n 122, at [52]â€“[53].   [227] We agree with the High Court Judge that at the time Mr Clayton, as trustee of 
the VRPT, arranged for the loans of the funds received from the BNZ to be advanced 
to the Chelmsford Trust, he did not intend to defeat Mrs Clayton's rights under the 
PRA in respect of the VRPT.  Our reasons are: 
(a) At  the  time  of  the  loan,  Mr  Clayton  would  not  have  regarded 
Mrs Clayton as having rights to claim against the assets of the VRPT. 
She was only a discretionary beneficiary of the VRPT with no legal or 
equitable  interest  or  right  in  the property  of  the  trust  which  could  be 
defeated by the advance.163 
(b) The  advance  from  the  VRPT  to  the  Chelmsford  Trust  did  not  defeat 
Mrs Clayton's rights because it was (and remains) an asset of the 
VRPT  which  will  be  taken  into  account  in  calculating  Mrs  Clayton's 
claim to an equal share in the net equity of the value of the  assets of 
the VRPT.164 
[228] We   therefore   uphold   the   decision   of   the   Family   Court   in   respect   of 
Mr Clayton's personal loan only and remit the case to the High Court for: 
(a) further submissions to be received in respect of the appropriate order 
to be made under s 44 in light of this judgment; and 
(b) in  accordance  with  the  agreement  of  the  parties,  the  quantum  of 
Mrs Clayton's entitlement to be calculated. 
(d) The Lighter Quay 5B Trust 
[229] This Trust was  established on 1 September 2009.  Mr Cheshire is the settlor 
and New Zealand Trustee Services  Ltd is the trustee.  Mr Cheshire holds the power 
of appointment and is one of the discretionary  beneficiaries, together  with any trust 
of  which  he  is  a  discretionary  beneficiary  and  any  charitable  organisation.    Neither 
Mr nor Mrs Clayton are beneficiaries. 
                                                 163  Above at [52]â€“[54]. 164  Above at [113].   [230] The  Trust  was  formed  to  hold  an  apartment  in  Auckland,  financed  by  an 
advance  of  $100,000  from  the  VRPT  and  a  loan  from  the  BNZ  of  $1,090,000.165  
The  apartment  was  sold  before  the  hearing  and  the  proceeds  of  sale  held  pending 
orders in the Family Court. 
[231] The  accounts  of  the  Trust  as  at  31  March  2011  include  the  following 
liabilities: 
(a) The VRPT $233,210 
(b) The BNZ Nil 
[232] The accounts of the VRPT as at 31 March 2011 include as an asset a loan to 
the Lighter Quay 5B Trust of $233,210. 
The Family Court decision 
[233] Judge  Munro  said  it  was  clear  that  Mr  Cheshire  held  the  property  for 
Mr Clayton.166  That finding is not in dispute.  The Judge concluded that s 44 applied 
by  virtue  of  the  advance  from  the  VRPT  which  defeated  Mrs Clayton's interest in 
those  funds.    She  held  that  Mrs  Clayton  was  entitled  to  one  half  of  the  net  sale 
proceeds. 
The High Court decision 
[234] Rodney Hansen J said: [128] As  with  the  Chelmsford  Trust,  I  have  doubts  whether a  finding  of 
intent to defeat under s 44 is available or that the order made is effective if it 
is.  Again, I consider the best course is for the Family Court to reconsider the 
issue after receiving any further evidence necessitated by the finding in this 
judgment.                                                  165  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [126]. 166  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [113].   The appeal 
[235] As  with  the  previous  trusts,  Mrs  Clayton  seeks  to  have  the  judgment  of  the 
Family  Court  reinstated  in  respect  of  the  Lighter  Quay  5B  Trust.    Lady Chambers 
submits that s 44 is applicable because: 
(a) the  apartment,  which  was  the  sole  asset of  the  Trust,  was  acquired 
from Mr Clayton's property, namely an advance of $233,210 from the 
VRPT;167 
(b) the evidence established that Mr Cheshire had become the sole trustee 
and held the property for Mr Clayton; and  
(c) Mr  Clayton  adduced  no  evidence  to establish  that  the  apartment  had 
been acquired after the separation from his separate property. 
[236] For  Mr  Clayton,  Mr  Carruthers  submits  that  the  High  Court  decision  was 
correct because no property was disposed of by Mr Clayton to the Lighter Quay 5B 
Trust.   The  apartment  was  paid  for  by  a  loan  from  the  BNZ  of  $1,090,000  and 
$100,000 from the BNZ through the VRPT. 
Discussion 
[237]  For reasons similar to those given in respect of Mrs Clayton's claim to the 
property of the Chelmsford Trust,168 none of the loans to the Lighter Quay 5B Trust 
was made with the intention of defeating Mrs Clayton's rights under the PRA. 
[238] Mrs Clayton's claim under s 44 in respect of this trust therefore fails and the 
decisions of the Courts below are overturned. 
The answer to the question [239] Accordingly, we answer the question as follows:                                                   167  As  with  the  Chelmsford  Trust,  Lady  Chambers  takes  this  figure  from  the  Trust's  financial 
statements as at 31 March 2011. 168  Above at [227].   Can  the  Court  be  satisfied  in  terms  of  s  44  of  the  PRA  that  there  has  been  a 
disposition  of  property  to  any  of  the  Trustees  of  the  Denarau  Resort Trust,  Sophia 
No 7 Trust, Chelmsford Trust and the Lighter Quay 5B Trust by Mr Clayton in order 
to defeat Mrs Clayton's claim under the Act where those Trusts have been settled 
after the date of separation and where s 9(4) of the PRA applies? 
Answer:  Yes in respect of the Denarau Resort Trust and the Sophia No 7 Trust.  Yes 
in respect of Mr Clayton's personal loan to the Chelmsford Trust.  No in respect of 
the VRPT's loan to the Chelmsford Trust.  No in respect of the Lighter Quay No 5 
Trust. 
Valuation of business interests 
[240] For convenience, we set out the question for determination: Did  the  Courts  below  err  in  finding  that,  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the 
value of business interests, an EBITDA of $6.75 million169 and a multiple of 
6.25 per cent should be adopted? [241] In  the  Family  Court,  three  expert  witnesses  gave  evidence about  the  share 
value of the Clayton group of companies.  The business comprised operations in both 
New Zealand  and  the  United  States.    The  New  Zealand  business  interests  were 
owned  and  controlled  by  Mr  Clayton  through  Clayton  Holdings  Ltd.    There  were 
also  sales  made  overseas,  a  substantial  part  of  which  comprised  sales  to  the 
United States.    The  sales  to  the  United  States  were  made  through  a  partnership,  a 
50 per  cent  share  in  which  was  ultimately  owned  by  the  Claymark  International 
Trust.    The  trustee  of  the  Claymark  International  Trust  is  Clayton  International 
Trustee  Ltd  in  which  Mr  Clayton  owns  100  per  cent  of  the  shares.    Mrs  Clayton  is 
not a beneficiary of that trust.   
[242] It was common ground between the experts that the market value of shares in 
the Claymark  group  should  be  based  on  a  capitalisation  of  earnings.   That  required 
ascertaining  future  maintainable  earnings  and  applying  a  multiple  to  achieve  an 
enterprise  value  from  which  debt  is  deducted.    The  figure  for  future  maintainable 
earnings was expressed as EBITDA.170 
                                                 169  The correct figure is $6.75 million, not $6.7 million as originally submitted for consideration.   170  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.     [243] The  High  Court  Judge  summarised  the  differing  approaches  of  the  three 
valuers and the Family Court Judge's conclusions in these terms: [46] The  valuer  called  by  Mrs  Clayton,  Mr  Brendan  Lyne,  used a  figure 
for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 
$7m and a multiple of 6.25.  Mr Clayton called two valuers, Mr James Dent 
and Mr John Hagen.  Mr Dent and Mr Hagen respectively adopted EBITDAs 
of $6.75m and $5.54m and multiples of 5.2 and 4.75.  These led to radically 
different valuations.  On Mr Hagen's approach, Claymark New Zealand has 
a negative value after deduction of debt. 
[47] Mr  Lyne  valued  the  property  pool  at  $28,831,000,  of  which  he 
attributed $17,569,000 to Claymark New Zealand and $695,000 to the value 
of the United States operation.  Mr Dent valued the property pool at $11.5m 
excluding,  however,  the  two  education  trusts,  although  he  said  that,  in  the 
case   of   a   distressed   sale,   realisable   value   could   be   much   less.      On 
Mr Hagen's approach, after deduction  of  debt  of  $31m,  Clayton  Holdings 
Limited has a negative value. 
[48] Judge  Munro  adopted  Mr  Dent's  EBITDA  of  $6.75m  and  the 
multiple of 6.25 advocated by Mr Lyne.  Subject to modifying the EBITDA 
to  $6.75m  and  to  other  adjustments  which  are  not  relevant  for  present 
purposes,  she  accepted  the  evidence  of  Mr  Lyne  as  to  the  value  of  the 
Claymark  Group.    Mr  Clayton  says  that  the  Judge  erred  in  her  findings  on 
both elements.  [244] For Mr Clayton Mrs  Harley submitted both in the High Court  and before us 
that the Family Court Judge: 
(a) should  not  have  adopted  EBITDA  of  $6.75  million  because  no  value 
for  the  United  States  operation  should  have  been  included  in  the 
calculation; and 
(b) should  not  have  adopted  the  multiple  of  6.25 per  cent  advocated  by 
Mr   Lyne   because   he   incorrectly   applied   a   25 per   cent   control 
premium. 
[245] Mrs  Harley  submitted  that  the  Family  Court  Judge  should  have  adopted 
EBITDA of $5.2 million and a multiple of 5.2 per cent. 
The EBITDA figure 
[246] The  Family  Court  Judge  recorded  that  Mr  Lyne  had adopted  EBITDA  of 
$7 million based on the EBITDA actually achieved by Clayton Holdings Ltd for the   five  years  prior  to  the  hearing;  monthly  compliance  certificates  provided  by  the 
Claymark  group  to  the  ASB  bank  which  indicated  an  increasing  EBITDA  for  the 
2011 year from $6.04 million at the start of the year to $6.882 million as at 31 March 
2011;  and  forecasts  prepared  for  the  Claymark  group  indicating  an  anticipated 
EBITDA  of  $9  million  over  the  next  two  years  (as  presented  in  the  form  of  a 
Strategic Plan to the ASB in October 2010).171  She noted that Mr Dent had adopted 
similar EBITDA of $6.7 million but, unlike Mr Lyne, he had  excluded any  revenue 
from  the  pending  installation  of  a  finger  jointer  (a  machine  we  understand  to  be 
designed to add value to finished timber).172  Both Mr Lyne and Mr Dent had taken 
into account a continuing unfavourable exchange rate and difficult trading conditions 
in the timber industry.  The Family Court Judge discounted Mr Hagen's estimate of 
EBITDA because it related only to Clayton Holdings Ltd.173 
[247] The  Family  Court  Judge  went  on  to  deal  in  some  detail  with  the  evidence 
relating  to  the  finger  jointer.174  A  deposit  had  been  paid  but  the  machine  had  not 
been installed at the date of hearing.  She accepted Mr Lyne's approach that, on the 
basis  the  machine  would  be  installed  late  in  2011,  some  allowance  should  be  made 
for  the  likelihood  of  the  finger  jointer coming  into  production.    She  noted  Mr Lyne 
had  not  included  in  his  valuation  the  full  anticipated  increase  in  income  of  some 
$800,000 from that source. 
[248] Despite  these  findings,  the  Judge  adopted  Mr  Dent's  lower  figure  for 
EBITDA  of  $6.75 million  taking  into  account  particularly  the  uncertainties  in 
predicting  the   future  exchange  rate,  the  negative  impact  this  would  have  on 
profitability  if  it  worsened  significantly  and  general  uncertainty  in  the  international 
economy.175 
[249] In the High Court, Rodney Hansen J upheld the finding by the Family Court 
Judge.  He rejected Mrs Harley's contention that the Family Court Judge had erred in 
adopting  EBITDA  of  $6.75  million  because  it  resulted  in  a  value  being  put  on  the 
                                                 171  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [120]. 172  At [122]. 173  At [123]. 174  At [124]â€“[126]. 175  At [127]â€“[133].   United  States  business  interests.    He  found  this  submission  was  not  supported  by 
Mr Dent's evidence.176  Before us, Mrs Harley challenged the Judge's finding in this 
respect. 
[250] A  curious  feature  of  the  judgments  in  both  the  Family  Court  and  the 
High Court is that neither refer to a second valuation provided by Mr Dent in which 
he assessed EBITDA for Clayton Holdings Ltd at a mid-point of $5.75 million.  The 
mid-point  figure  was  based  on  the  company's  actual  results  for  the  2009â€“2011 
financial years plus that projected for 2012.  This excluded any earnings from the US 
business. 
[251] Mrs Harley submitted that it was appropriate to exclude the earnings from the 
United States business because the Family Court Judge had found that the Claymark 
International Trust had no assets that could be the subject of a claim by Mrs Clayton.  
It  had  acted  as  a  conduit  for  funds  from  the  United  States  sales  to  be  channelled  to 
the New Zealand  entities in the Claymark  group.177  According to the evidence of a 
chartered  accountant  associated  with  the  group  (Mr  Giesbers),  the  United  States 
operation accounted for some 15 per cent of the total EBITDA for the New Zealand 
and United States business.  
[252] We are not persuaded that there was any material error by the Family Court in 
adopting Mr Dent's first EBITDA assessment of $6.75 million prepared in 2010.  At 
that time Mr Dent found that the Clayton Group had "normalised" EBITDA over the 
period 2006â€“2010 in the range of $6.088 million to $6.6 million.  He described the 
group as having had a consistent level of performance over the last five years despite 
significant  fluctuations  in  production  volumes,  sales  mix  and  economic  conditions.  
Adjusted   for   inflation,   the   EBITDA   averaged   $6.5   million   and   ranged   from 
$5.6 million to $7 million.   Mr Dent concluded that EBITDA should be assessed at 
$6.5 million to $7 million at that time with a mid-point of $6.75 million.   
[253] As  the  High  Court  Judge  found,  Mr  Dent  did  not  in  his  first  affidavit 
specifically  attribute  a  value  to  the  United  States  business  or  to  the  advances  made 
                                                 176  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [49]â€“[54]. 177  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [96].     by Claymark to that business.  He gave detailed reasons why he considered there was 
minimal net value in the assets of the United States business and concluded that "my 
approach  of  not  allowing  for  additional  value  in  the  United  States  operations  is 
reasonable".178 
[254] He also attached to his first affidavit a valuation he had prepared dated 9 June 
2010.    This  referred  to  pro  forma  accounts  prepared  by  Clayton  management 
consolidating the New Zealand and United States business operations for the year to 
31 March 2009.  In this valuation, Mr Dent concluded it was apparent that the actual 
operating  performance  and  financial  position  of  the  business  was  not  materially 
altered  by  the  consolidation  of  the  United  States  operation.179  On  this  footing, 
Mr Dent's first valuation of EBITDA at $6.75 million did not attribute any  material 
earnings to the United States operation.   
[255] In a second affidavit Mr Dent revised his EBITDA assessment.  He gave his 
opinion that: 180 ...  a  reasonable,  estimate  of  maintainable  EBITDA  ...  would  be  in  the 
vicinity of $5.25â€“$6.25 million, with a mid-point of $5.75 million ... [256] These figures were for Clayton Holdings Ltd excluding any earnings from the 
United States business.  He based his high point on the company's actual results for 
the 2006â€“2010  years, draft results for 2011 and  a forecast for 2012.  The mid-point 
was based as the average of the three years, 2009â€“2011. 
[257] Mr  Dent  was  challenged  in  cross-examination  on  his  reduced  assessment  of 
EBITDA.181  In particular, there had been a significant drop in EBITDA for Clayton 
Holdings  Ltd  from the  audited  result  in  the  2010  year  ($7.088  million)  to  the  draft 
results for 2011 ($4.16 million).  Mr Dent agreed that over the same two year period, 
the    EBITDA    for    Clayton    International    had    increased    from    $88,000    to 
                                                 178  Mr Dent's first affidavit, sworn on 19 May 2011, at [62] and [63]. 179  Mr Dent's first affidavit, sworn on 19 May 2011, Appendix II, at [63]â€“[65]. 180  Mr Dent's second affidavit, sworn on 19 May 2011, at [13].   181  Family Court Notes of Evidence taken before Judge Munro, 6 July 2011, starting at 442.   $2.66 million.182  It  is  apparent  that any  reduction  in  earnings  from  New  Zealand 
sales had been offset substantially by attributing earnings to the US operation.   
[258] The  Family  Court  Judge  accepted  that  it  was  not  appropriate  to  exclude  the 
earnings  of  the  United  States  business  in  the  EBITDA  assessment.    She  accepted 
Mr Lyne's  assessment  of  the  value  of  the  Claymark  group,  including  the 
United States  business,  but  with  certain  adjustments.183  These  included  adopting 
Mr Dent's initial assessment of EBITDA at the mid-point  figure  of  $6.75  million 
rather  than  Mr Lyne's figure of $7 million.   As  earlier  noted,  the  main  reasons  for 
this  were  adverse  changes  in  the  exchange  rates  between  New  Zealand  and  the 
United States and uncertainty in the international economic outlook. 
[259] The  Judge  was  entitled  to  include  the  earnings  from  the  United  States 
business  in  the  EBITDA  assessment.    In  view  of  the  conclusions  she  reached  about 
Mr Clayton's  intention  to  defeat  the  interests  of  Mrs  Clayton  in  the  Claymark 
International  Trust,  it  was  appropriate  to  treat  the  United  States  earnings  as  part  of 
the overall earnings of the Claymark group.  We accept Lady Chambers' submission 
that  the  finding  in  the  Family  Court  that  the  Claymark  International  Trust  had  no 
assets  which  could  be  the  subject  of  a  claim  under  the  Act  does  not  preclude  the 
earnings from the United States business being included in the EBITDA assessment. 
[260] We record that we sought further submissions on this issue which have been 
considered.   We are  grateful to Ms McCartney  QC for her submissions184 on behalf 
of  Mr Clayton  but  they  do  not  cause  us  to  alter  our  view.   A  fresh  point  raised  by 
Ms McCartney  was  that  the  valuations  were  to  be  undertaken  at  the  date  of 
hearing.185  There is nothing in this point since the assessment of all the experts was 
based  on  future  maintainable  earnings  taking  into  account  the  historic  performance 
of the business and the likely future outlook.  The actual date of the assessment (as 
between 2010 and 2011) was not material in this context.   
                                                 182  We were referred to other figures suggesting that the EBITDA for the US business was as low as 
$6,000 in the 2010 year.   183  Family Court judgment, above n 1, at [133].   184  In place of the late Mrs Harley who passed away subsequent to the hearing.   185  This  was agreed to be at the  end of the  2011 financial  year; see Family Court judgment, above 
n 1, at [119].     [261] The  assessment  of  the  value  of  the  Clayton  group  was  very  much  a  matter 
upon which the Family Court Judge was required to exercise her discretion.  Like the 
High  Court  Judge,  we  see  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  conclusion  of  the  Family 
Court Judge on this issue.  
The calculation of the multiple 
[262] The only point relied upon by Mrs Harley under this heading is that the Judge 
erred in adopting Mr Lyne's multiple of 6.25 per cent.  She did not dispute that a 
control  premium  of  25  per  cent  could  be  applied.    Rather,  she  submitted  that 
Mr Lyne's calculation  was  in  error  because  he  applied  the  control  premium  to  the 
EBITDA  multiple  which  is  used  to  value  the  enterprise  as  a  whole  whereas,  as 
Mr Dent explained, the control premium is applied to the equity of the business, that 
is the enterprise value less debt.  Mrs Harley presented a calculation of the premium 
which she said should have led to a corrected multiple of 5.31 per cent.186   
[263] The Family Court Judge observed that Mr Lyne's multiple of 6.25 was based 
on  multiples  adopted  by  a  range  of  other  companies  which  he  detailed  in  his 
evidence:    a  multiple  of  7.0  adopted  by  Tenon  Ltd,  a  timber  processing  export 
company of a similar character to Claymark;187 and a multiple of 6.84 utilised in the 
course  of  negotiations  undertaken  in  late  2010  between  Claymark  and  Carter  Holt 
Harvey for the purchase of Carter Holt Harvey's Profiles business.188   
[264] The Family Court Judge noted that Mr Dent was less specific as to the basis 
of his choice of multiple.  He had taken into account statistics provided by Biz Stats 
(which the Judge said provided statistics for very much smaller companies) and also 
his experience and knowledge from his involvement with primary industries.  
[265] The  Family  Court  Judge  observed  that  the  major  difference  between  the 
multiple adopted by Mr  Lyne  (6.25) and Mr Dent (5.2) was Mr Lyne's inclusion of 
                                                 186  We note this differs slightly from the submission that the multiple should have been 5.2 per cent 
but that is not material for present purposes. 187  The  Family  Court  Judge  accepted  that  there  were  differences  between  Claymark  and  Tenon  in 
that  Tenon  was  a  listed  company  and  was  significantly  larger  than  Claymark.    However,  there 
was  agreement  between  the  valuers  that,  while  there  was  no  directly  comparable  company, 
Tenon was the closest.   188  A transaction that did not in the end proceed.     the control premium.  Mr Dent had not adopted a control premium in his valuation.  
However,  both  had  allowed  for  a  marketability  discount  of  20  per  cent.    This  is 
intended   to   reflect   the   difficulties   sometimes   associated   with   the   disposal   of 
100 per cent  of  the  shares  in  a  business  enterprise.    The  Family  Court  Judge  noted 
that if Mr Lyne's choice of multiple did not include a control premium, the multiple 
would have been 5.6. 
[266] She  found  it  was  appropriate  to  include  a  control  premium  as  well  as  a 
marketability discount.  She accepted Mr Lyne's opinion that it was appropriate to 
include a control premium where 100 per cent of the shares in the company were for 
sale.  She noted Mr Hagen's evidence that it was appropriate  to  include  a  control 
premium  where  the  owner  could  influence  cash  flows.    She  found  there  was  no 
evidence  to  support  the  proposition  that  this  should  not  apply  to  the  Clayton  group 
business. 
[267] Mr Lyne explained that in adopting a mid-point earnings multiple of 6.25, he 
had  obtained  various  multiples  as  reported  on  the  capital  IQ  database.189  He  set 
these figures out in a table190 and then observed:191 The  median  EBITDA  multiple  for  historic  and  prospective  earnings  are  7.9 
and  8.2.    The  similar  multiples  for Tenon  are  7.0  and  7.4.    To  arrive  at  a 
multiple  for  Claymark  I  assume  say  a  control  premium  for  Tenon  of  25% 
and  a  marketing discount of 20%, would result in a  comparable  multiple  of 
7.0 (i.e. 7.0 x (1+25%) x (1-20%) =  7.0 which is  higher than my  mid-point 
multiple of 6.25.  If instead I use the median multiple of 8.2 this results in a 
mid-point multiple applicable to Clayton of 8.2. [268] The High Court Judge was not persuaded that Mr Lyne's evidence was in 
error on this issue.  He concluded that Mr Lyne did not apply the control premium of 
25  per  cent  to  his  preferred  multiple.    Rather,  he  used  it  and  the  20 per cent 
marketing  discount  in  fixing  a  comparable  multiple  for  Tenon.    Mr Hagen  agreed 
that  was  how  Mr  Lyne  had  approached  the  matter.192  The  Judge  noted that  the 
marketing discount effectively cancelled out the control premium.  
                                                 189  Mr Lyne's affidavit, sworn on 21 June 201, at [33] and [34]. 190  At [33], Table 6. 191  At [34].   192  Family Court Notes of Evidence taken before Judge Munro, 6 July 2011, at 391.   [269] The High Court Judge went on to observe that Mr Dent's evidence as to the 
application  of  the  control  premium  was  not  put  in  any  adequate  way  to  Mr Lyne  in 
evidence.  On this issue the Judge said: [60] ... He [Mr Lyne] was asked in cross-examination  how  the  control 
premium  affected  his  choice  of  multiple.    After  being  quizzed  about  the 
quantum of the premium, and rejecting a suggestion that 25 per cent was at 
the "high end", he was asked: 
Q. Well, let's just take the control[led] (sic) premium out all 
together  for  the  moment.    Do  you  agree  that  you  get  a 
multiple of 5.6 without that control[led] (sic) premium being 
taken into account? 
To which he replied: 
A. Yes, mathematically you would, yeah. 
[61] The  questioner  (Mr  Carruthers  QC)  then  went  on  to  another  topic.  
Mr  Lyne  was  not  asked  to  explain  how  omission  of  the  control  premium 
reduced the multiple from 6.25 to 5.6.  The evidence of Mr Dent on the issue 
was never put to him.  What is clear, however, is that for the purpose of the 
Claymark multiple, the premium was much less than 25 per cent (11 per cent 
actually),  indicating  that  Mr  Lyne  was  alive  to  the  need  to  apply  a  reduced 
premium for the purpose of valuing the equity of the business. [270] We would add that the "correct" calculation of the multiple produced by 
Mrs Harley  arriving  at  a  multiple  of  5.31  was  relied  upon  in  the  High  Court  in 
submissions and again before us but was not put to Mr Lyne in evidence.   
[271] Mrs Harley referred us to a textbook on business valuation.193  This was put 
to Mr Hagen by counsel for Mrs Clayton in evidence in the Family Court.  Mr Hagen 
agreed that it referred to control premiums of 30 to 35 per cent in takeover situations.  
But  Mr  Hagen  said  the  author  was discussing  price  earnings  ratios  for  shares.  
Multiples  in  that  context  were  quite  different  and  not  comparable  to  multiples 
applying  to  EBITDA.    Mr  Hagen  agreed  that  Mr  Lyne's  control  premium  was 
significantly lower than the percentages referred to in Mr Lonergan's text.  Although 
the text also referred to difficulties arising if a control premium were added to a price 
earnings  ratio,  we  do  not  view  this  as  relevant  to  the  issues  we  have  to  consider 
given Mr Hagen's evidence about the difference in context.   
                                                 193  Wayne  Lonergan The  Valuation of Business, Shares and Other Equity (4th ed, Allen &  Unwin, 
Frenchs Forest (NSW), 2003) at 55â€“56.     [272] The final conclusion of the High Court Judge on this issue was expressed in 
these terms: [64] It  is  clear  that  the  Judge  fully  appreciated  the  arguments  for  and 
against including a control premium.  Her decision to prefer the evidence of 
Mr Lyne is clearly and persuasively articulated.  There is nothing to indicate 
error  in  the  way  the  control  premium  was  factored  into  the  multiple 
advocated  by  Mr  Lyne  which  was  well  within  the  available  range  and 
supported  by,  amongst  other  things,  the  Tenon  multiple  and  the  multiple 
adopted for the purpose of the Carter Holt Harvey negotiations referred to by 
the Judge. [273] We  entirely  agree  with  the  analysis  of  the  High  Court  Judge  for  the  reasons 
he  gave.    We  would  add  that  all  the  experts  agreed  that  assessing  the  value of  a 
business  enterprise  involves  a  combination  of  art  and  science.    Both  Mr  Dent  and 
Mr Hagen  emphasised  the  need  to  arrive  at  a  reasonable  result  overall.    Inevitably, 
the  assessment  of  the  value  of  the  Clayton  business  interests  was  a  discretionary 
exercise.    We  are  not  persuaded  that  the  Family  Court  erred  in  any  respect  in 
reaching its conclusions on this issue.   
The answer to the question 
[274] Accordingly, we answer the question as follows: Did the Courts below err in finding that, for the purpose of calculating the value of 
business  interests,  an  EBITDA  of  $6,750,000  and  a  multiple  of  6.25  per  cent 
should be adopted? 
Answer:   No. Result 
[275] For the reasons given: 
(a) We  formally  grant  leave  for  question  (c)  relating  to  the  VRPT  to  be 
considered.   
(b) The questions for which leave was granted are answered as set out in 
this judgment at [116], [147], [178], [239] and [274].   (c) The  issue  of  the  appropriate  order  to  be  made  under  s  44  of  the PRA in 
respect   of   the   Chelmsford   Trust   is   remitted   to   the   High   Court   for 
determination in light of this judgment. 
(d) Issues of quantum are remitted to the High Court for determination in 
light of this judgment.   
(e) By consent, order D in the sealed High Court judgment (relating to the 
value of Claymark International Trust's business interests) is quashed.   
Costs 
[276] Costs should follow the event.  As Mrs Clayton has been largely successful in 
CA473/2013 and CA474/2013, but unsuccessful in CA438/2013, we consider she is 
entitled  to  an  order  that  the  appellants  in  the  appeals  where  she  was  largely 
successful should pay her 75 per cent of the costs in respect of all the appeals for a 
complex appeal on a Band B basis with usual disbursements.  We certify for second 
counsel. 
[277] We  do  not  consider  that  Mrs  Clayton  is  entitled  to  an  uplift  for  timetable 
failures.  Mr Clayton has not contributed unnecessarily to the time or expense of the 
appeal  through  his  timetable  failures  such  as  to  activate  our  jurisdiction  under 
r 53E(2) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.194
