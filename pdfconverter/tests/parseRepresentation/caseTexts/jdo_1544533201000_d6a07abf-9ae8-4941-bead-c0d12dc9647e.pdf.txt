Solicitors:
Meredith Connell (Auckland) for Respondent   Introduction
[1] On 23 March 2018, following a Judge alone trial, Judge PA Cunningham
convicted Mr Kumar on a charge of indecent assault.1
[2] Mr Kumar appeals his conviction.  He contends justice miscarried because he
was not told he had a right to trial by jury and because he was not given adequate
advice on whether he should give evidence at his trial (he elected not to give evidence).
[3] My task is to decide whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred:2 ... miscarriage of justice means any error, irregularity, or occurrence in or in
relation to or affecting the trial that—
(a) has created a real risk that the outcome of the trial was affected; or
(b) has resulted in an unfair trial or a trial that was a nullity. Background
[4] Mr Kumar and the complainant worked at a fast-food shop.  On 2 June 2017,
after the shop had closed, Mr Kumar and the complainant started to clean up and put
food into refrigerators.  The complainant said Mr Kumar at one point blocked her path
and kissed her, putting his tongue inside her mouth and putting his hand inside her t-
shirt, pushing it down the waistline of her pants to her buttock.  The complainant said
she tried to push Mr Kumar away but he persisted and groped her breast, unhooking
her bra.  The complainant threatened to make trouble for Mr Kumar if he persisted and
he stopped what he was doing.
[5] When spoken to by the Police, Mr Kumar denied touching the complainant but
said she had asked him for money and he had refused to give it to her.
The Appeal
[6] Mr Kumar's appeal is not brought on the basis justice miscarried because the
trial Judge either misunderstood the evidence or made decisions not properly founded
                                                 1  Police v Kumar [2018] NZDC 5829. 2  Criminal Procedure Act 2011, s 232(4).   by the evidence.  An appeal on that basis could not succeed.  The Judge heard evidence
from the complainant, the restaurant owner (who was told of the incident and gave
evidence of what both parties told him about it), the owner's wife, and the police
officer who spoke to Mr Kumar and arrested him.  The Judge also had the benefit of
propensity evidence about a very similar incident which occurred on 1 August 2016.
Mr Kumar was charged with indecent assault in respect of that incident.  The charge
was later transmuted to one of common assault and Mr Kumar was discharged without
conviction shortly before the incident with which this appeal is concerned.  There can
be no challenge to Mr Kumar's conviction by Judge Cunningham on the basis of the
evidence before the Judge and how she appraised it.
[7] Instead, Mr Kumar's appeal is based on a denial of proper process.  He had a
right to elect trial by jury and he says he was deprived of this right because he was
never told about it.  Further, he had the right to give evidence at his trial, and he
contends his trial counsel failed to advise him properly as to whether he should or not.
As a result, he says, he decided not to give evidence, under the mistaken impression
the Judge would have his brief of evidence to refer to, and accordingly lost the
opportunity to put his side of the case.
Trial by jury
[8] As I have said, Mr Kumar had recently been discharged without conviction in
relation to a similar incident.  He was represented then by Mr Harder.  At the trial
before Judge Cunningham, Detective Constable Ball gave evidence that after she
arrested Mr Kumar on 15 June 2017, she took him to the Auckland Police Station.
Mr Kumar asked if he could speak to his lawyer and showed the Detective Constable
Mr Harder's  card.    The  officer  gave  Mr Kumar  time  to  speak to  Mr Harder  by
telephone in private and afterwards Mr Kumar declined to make a statement on DVD.
Mr Kumar did give a brief oral account of his side of the incident.  He said the
complainant asked for money, she became angry at his refusal, he swore at her, but did
not touch her.  He said: Why would I do this?  I have just finished the Court.  I couldn't sleep for eight
months because of it.   [9] Mr Kumar appeared in the District Court later that day.  He was seen by a duty
lawyer who helped him to fill out a legal aid form.  Mr Kumar's case was then called,
the duty lawyer entered a plea of not guilty to the charge and Mr Kumar was remanded
to a case review hearing to take place on 7 September 2017.
