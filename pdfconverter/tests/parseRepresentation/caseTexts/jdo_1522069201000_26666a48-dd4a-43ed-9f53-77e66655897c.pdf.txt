 JUDGMENT OF LANG J 
[on application for representation orders under r 4.24 of the High Court Rules] 
 
   This judgment was delivered by me on 26 March 2018 at 3.30 pm, 
pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  
 
Registrar/Deputy Registrar 
 
Date............... 
 
    [1] In this proceeding the plaintiffs advance several causes of action.  All arise out 
of dealings the second plaintiff, Ms Lee, had with members of the Te Kawerau ā Maki 
Iwi (the Iwi) during 2007 and 2008.   
[2] The plaintiffs now seek an order under r 4.24 of the High Court Rules 2016 
appointing the third defendants, the trustees of the Te Kawerau Iwi Settlement Trust 
(the Settlement trustees), to represent the members of the Iwi in this proceeding. 
[3] The Settlement trustees  initially  consented  to  the  order  being  made.  
Subsequently, however, they reconsidered their position.  They now oppose any order 
being made appointing them as representatives of the Iwi for the purpose of this 
proceeding. 
[4] The current version of the statement of claim contains six causes of action.  
Four of these relate to two joint venture agreements the first plaintiff, Tahi Enterprises 
Ltd (Tahi), entered into with members of the Iwi in 2007 and 2008.  Ms Lee is the sole 
shareholder and director of Tahi.   
[5] The remaining causes of action are based on transactions between Ms Lee and 
the first-named first respondent, Mr Te Warena Taua (Mr Taua).  These relate to a 
house property situated at 517 Oruarangi Road, Māngere (the Māngere property).   
A. The claim based on the two joint venture agreements 
The parties 
[6] The plaintiffs allege that Mr Taua is the Chairman and Rangatira/Chief of 
Te Kawerau ā Maki.  Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe, another senior member of the Iwi, were 
claimants on behalf of the Iwi in three claims filed in the Waitangi Tribunal.  Mrs Ewe 
died on 13 August 2009.  The second-named first respondent, Ms Miriama Tamaariki, 
is the executor of Mrs Ewe's estate.   
[7] The second respondents are the trustees of the Te Kawerau Iwi Tribal Authority 
(the Tribal Authority trustees), a charitable trust established on behalf of the Iwi under 
the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 by deed dated 13 July 2008.  The trust was established   for  purposes  including the negotiation  and  settlement  of  all  historical Treaty  of 
Waitangi claims on behalf of the Iwi.  The trust deed requires the Tribal Authority 
trustees to manage any settlement assets derived from treaty claims for the benefit of 
the members of the Iwi.  Mr Taua is the Chairman of the Tribal Authority Trust.  
[8] The third respondents are the trustees of the Te Kawerau ā Maki Settlement 
Trust (the Settlement trustees).  This was established by deed dated 21 February 2014 
for purposes including the receipt and administration of assets received by the Iwi after 
its settlement of  treaty  claims with  the  Crown.    These  were  settled  under  the 
Te Kawerau ā Maki Claims Settlement Act 2015 and the Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki 
Makaurau  Collective  Redress Act  2014.    Mr  Taua  is also the  Chairman  of  the 
Settlement Trust.  The amended statement of claim states that the Settlement trustees 
are to represent all members of the Iwi who were over the age of 18 years as at 27 June 
2007. 
[9] Neither the Iwi as a group nor individual members are named as respondents, 
but the statement of claim contains allegations against the Iwi and the plaintiffs seek 
relief against them.  The statement of claim describes the Iwi as: The collective group comprised of individuals who are descended from an 
ancestor of Te Kawerau ā Maki (as further defined in s 12 of the Te Kawerau 
Claim Settlement Act 2015) and includes those individuals.   The joint venture agreements 
[10] The first of the two joint venture agreements is dated 27 June 2007 (the 2007 
agreement), and the parties to that agreement are Tahi and "Te Kawerau ā Maki".  It 
was signed by Ms Lee on Tahi's behalf, and by Mr Taua and Mr Piki Taylor on behalf 
of Te Kawerau ā Maki.1   
[11] Under this agreement, Tahi agreed to provide funding of up to $2 million "in 
support of Te Kawerau's Treaty claims process".  Tahi was required to pay $1 million 
within three working days of execution of the agreement.  The balance of the money 
was to be paid "within 2 months after the signing of the Agreement in Principal with 
the Crown".   
                                                 1  Mr Taylor is not a party to the proceeding.   [12] In consideration for receiving these sums, Te Kawerau agreed that Tahi would 
be the Iwi's exclusive partner in all future joint venture developments.  Any profits 
from those undertakings would be shared as to 65 per cent by Te Kawerau and 35 per 
cent by Tahi.  
[13] The second agreement was signed on 22 July 2008 (the 2008 Agreement), and 
purported to vary the 2007 agreement.  The parties were again Tahi and "Te Kawerau 
ā Maki".  On this occasion the agreement was signed by Ms Lee on behalf of Tahi and 
by Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe on behalf of Te Kawerau.  The agreement recorded that they 
had "authority to sign this agreement on behalf of Te Kawerau".2   
[14] Under the 2008 agreement, Te Kawerau ā Maki was defined as "Te Kawerau ā 
Maki iwi tribal authority".  The agreement confirmed that this group comprised: i) The collective group comprised of persons: 
(a) Who descend from the following ancestors: 
(i) Tawhia ki te Rangi (also known as Te Kawerau ā Maki); 
and 
(ii) Mana; and 
(iii) Te Au o Te Whenua; and 
(iv) Kowhatu ki te Uru 
ii) Every whanau, hapu or group of persons to the extent that the whanau, 
hapu or group includes persons referred to 4.i and 
iii) Every person referred to in clause 4.i. [15] In addition, the 2008 agreement contained the following clause: It is reasonably foreseeable that upon the successful settlement of the Treaty 
Claims with the Crown, Te Kawerau will use or form various entities ("related 
entities") that are associated or controlled by Te Kawerau to govern, manage 
and develop all assets being settled.  Both parties agree that this agreement 
should also be binding on all those related entities. [16] Under the 2008 agreement Tahi agreed to "provide total funding up to and not 
exceeding NZ$2,000,000 ... in support of the Te Kawerau's Treaty claims process".  
                                                 2  Clause 15.   The parties acknowledged that Tahi had already paid the sum of $1 million.  The 
balance was to be paid in instalments on the occurrence of specified events during the 
treaty claims settlement process.  
[17] Importantly for present purposes, Te Kawerau was to repay the sums advanced 
under the agreement in accordance with the following clause: 13) As  soon  as  Te  Kawerau  or  any  related  entities  receive any  cash 
settlement (including and not limiting to accumulated rentals related to 
Crown Forest Licences) from the Crown of not less than $2,000,000, 
Te Kawerau agrees to ensure the prompt repayment of the sum of 
$2,000,000 capital back to Tahi Enterprises.  Payment to be made within 
two months of receipt. [18] The 2008 agreement reiterated that all profits and interests arising from "future 
business endeavours" were to be shared as to 65 per cent to Te Kawerau and 35 per 
cent to Tahi.  It also recorded that, save as varied by the 2008 agreement, the 2007 
agreement was to "remain in full force and effect". 
Subsequent events 
[19] The statement of claim alleges that the Tribal Authority trustees entered into 
an agreement with the Crown on 7 August 2008 setting out the terms of negotiation of 
the Iwi's Treaty of Waitangi treaty claims.  On 5 September 2008, Tahi paid the sum 
of $200,000 into a bank account nominated by Mr Taua as required by the 2008 
agreement.  On 2 October 2008, Tahi paid a further sum of $100,000 into the same 
account.   
[20] Then, on or about 12 February 2010, the Crown and the Iwi entered into a 
written agreement in principle to settle the Iwi's treaty claims.  The terms of the 
agreement in principle were set out in a letter dated 12 February 2010 from the 
Attorney-General and Minister of Māori Affairs to Mr Taua.  Ten days later, on or 
about 22 February 2014, the Crown entered into a deed of settlement with Te Kawerau 
ā Maki and the Settlement trustees setting out the terms for settlement of the Iwi's 
treaty claims.     [21] The Te Kawerau ā Maki Claims Settlement Act 2015 came into force on 
15 September 2015 and took effect 14 days thereafter.  Under this Act the Iwi's treaty 
claims were settled on the basis that the Crown would transfer nominated properties 
to the Settlement Trust and would also make certain payments to it.  In addition, the 
Crown granted the Settlement trustees the option to purchase several parcels of land, 
and the right of first refusal to purchase other parcels of land.   
[22] Under the Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau Collective Redress Act 
2014 (the Redress Act), Te Kawerau ā Maki and 12 other iwi / hapu were collectively 
granted certain rights and interests by way of redress for historical treaty breaches by 
the Crown.  These included the ownership of certain parcels of land and the right to 
purchase other land.   
[23] By letter dated 27 September 2006 the solicitors acting for the respondents 
purported to cancel the 2007 and 2008 agreements.  Tahi and Ms Lee then filed this 
proceeding in response. 
Representation orders 
[24] Rule 4.24 of the High Court Rules provides: 4.24  Persons having same interest 
One or more persons may sue or be sued on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all 
persons with the same interest in the subject matter of a proceeding— 
(a)   with the consent of the other persons who have the same interest; or 
(b)   as directed by the court on an application made by a party or intending 
party to the proceeding. [25] The  courts  have  traditionally  taken  a  liberal  approach  to  representative 
proceedings because they often assist in achieving the objective set out in r 1.2, which 
is to secure "the just, speedy and inexpensive" determination of proceedings.  A 
proliferation  of  separate  proceedings  involving  the  same  subject matter  would 
obviously be contrary to that object.    [26] The leading authorities in relation to representation orders made under 4.24 are 
the judgments of the Court of Appeal in Saunders v Houghton3 and that of the Supreme 
Court in Credit Suisse Private Equity LLC v Houghton.4   
[27] Delivering the judgment of the majority in Credit Suisse, Glazebrook J noted 
that the principal purpose of a representative proceeding is the promotion of efficiency 
and economy of litigation.5  The rule should therefore be applied in a flexible manner 
so as to achieve the overall objective as set out in r 1.2.6  There is room for continual 
development in this area so long as defendants are not compromised.7 
[28] The  Chief  Justice,  writing  for  herself  and  Anderson  J, summarised  the 
approach now taken in New Zealand as follows: [53] Because it is recognised that representative actions may be oppressive 
and may work injustice, use of representative form is subject to the three 
conditions ultimately derived from the judgment of Vinelott J in Prudential 
Assurance, although Vinelott J's requirement of a "common element" in each 
cause of action is more restrictive than [the] modern approach taken in such 
cases as Carnie and R J Flowers.  The approach now taken in New Zealand is 
that: 
(a) the order cannot confer a right of action on a member of the 
represented class who would not otherwise have been able to 
assert a claim in separate proceedings and cannot bar a defence 
otherwise available in a separate action; 
(b) there must be a common issue of fact or law of significance for 
each member of the class represented; and 
(c) it must be for the benefit of the other members of the class that 
the plaintiff is able to sue in a representative capacity. 
(footnotes omitted) [29] The Chief Justice then observed: [55] The representative procedure was introduced to simplify previous 
recourse to joinder of claims and thereby achieve savings in effort.  In its 
modern form it does not require identity of claim or even the same cause of 
action.  As the language of r 4.24 indicates, it is enough that there is "the same 
interest in the subject matter of the proceeding".  When the common issues                                                  3  Saunders v Houghton [2009] NZCA 610, [2010] 3 NZLR 331. 4  Credit Suisse Private Equity LLC v Houghton [2014] NZSC 37, [2014] 1 NZLR 541.  5  At [147]. 6  At [129]-[130]. 7  At [152].   are resolved, it may be necessary to organise the hearing of the remaining 
issues according to subcategories or even on a devolved individual basis.  
Representative form does not prevent later severance should that be necessary 
to deal with particular issues relating to the individual circumstances of those 
within the representative action nor does it prevent sequencing of hearing in 
the manner adopted by French J through directions. 
(footnotes omitted) [30] This passage demonstrates that the key issue for present purposes is whether 
the parties who will be subject to the proposed order have "the same interest in the 
subject matter of the proceeding".  That may arise where there is a common issue to 
be tried that affects all members of the represented group.  The Chief Justice saw 
nothing wrong with the courts using case management techniques to conduct staged 
trials once common issues have been resolved.  This means that an initial trial may be 
held in which the issue of liability on one or more issues is determined.  Thereafter the 
issue of relief, or damages, may be determined through a series of subsequent trials 
designed to ensure that the differences between individuals within the represented 
group are recognised.8  It is also important to bear in mind, however, that the rule 
cannot be used to create an injustice.9 
[31] In this context care needs to be taken with a passage relied on by the plaintiffs 
from McGechan on Procedure.  The learned authors of that text point out that earlier 
case  law  suggested  a  representative  proceeding  would  be  inappropriate  "where 
members could be subject to different defences".10  They express the view that the 
liberal approach approved in Saunders v Houghton and Credit Suisse means "that the 
availability of different defences applicable to different defendants is no bar to a 
representative proceeding".11  That may be so, but it needs to be remembered that those 
cases were concerned with actions brought by representative plaintiffs. The quotation 
relied upon relates to the fact that a claim may be brought by representative plaintiffs 
even where the defendants may have defences to claims brought by some but not all 
plaintiffs.  In cases where the plaintiff seeks the appointment of a representative 
                                                 8  At [59]. 9  R J Flowers Ltd v Burns [1987] 1 NZLR 260 (HC) at 271, cited in Credit Suisse, above n 4 at [61]. 10  Andrew Beck and others McGechan on Procedure (online loosleaf ed, Brookers) at [HR 4.24.05] 
relying on R J Flowers Ltd v Burns, above n 9.  In that case McGechan J held (at 270) that members 
of the class to be represented all had to be able to claim as plaintiffs in separate actions in respect 
of the event in question, with no defences applicable to some only of the class. 11  At [HR 4.24.05].   defendant, the courts must be vigilant to ensure that administrative convenience does 
not come at the cost of injustice to the persons whom that person is appointed to 
represent. 
[32] The authority often cited in this context is the decision of the House of Lords 
in London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd.12  In that case there 
had been no application for an order appointing a representative defendant to defend 
a libel proceeding brought against an unincorporated association.  Lord Parker of 
Waddington  observed,  however,  that  such  an application  would  not  have  been 
successful because "there might be separate defences open to some members of the 
association and not to others, and if this were so there would be no common interest 
within the rule."13  The English rule permitting the appointment of representative 
plaintiffs and defendants at that time was in similar terms to r 4.24. 
[33] Lord Parker's obiter observation in Greenlands was subsequently cited in both 
English  and  New  Zealand  cases.   In Derby  v  Pukeikura, the  plaintiff  sought  a 
declaration that sawn timber cut from a block of Māori land was his property, as he 
claimed he had a licence to cut timber on the land.14  The plaintiff applied for an order 
under r 79 of the then Code of Civil Procedure appointing a single defendant to 
represent between 40 and 48 owners of the land.   That person had represented some 
of the owners in earlier negotiations with the plaintiff.  Fair J noted that the defences 
of one group of owners would be different to those of another.  In addition, the 
defences of persons within one of the two groups could vary according to the extent 
they had stood by while the plaintiff had cut timber on the land.  Fair J then observed:15 I have considered all the authorities cited by counsel, but I think it is necessary 
to refer to two cases only.  The judgment of Lord Parker in London Association 
for   Protection   of   Trade   v.   Greenlands   Ltd, ... decides  that  in  such 
circumstances the provisions of Order 16, r. 9 of the Rules of the Supreme 
Court (Eng.) – which are, as to the words to be construed in this application, 
identical with those of r. 79 of our Code – do not authorise a person in the 
position of the present defendant being appointed to represent either the first 
or the second group.  It was there said: "In other words, there might be separate 
defences open to some members of the Association and not to others, and if 
this were so there would be no common interest within the rule."                                                  12  London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd [1916] 2 AC 15 (HL). 13  At 39. 14  Derby v Pukeikura [1935] GLR 205 (SC). 15  At 206.   That statement was approved by the High Court and the Court of Appeal in 
Hardie  and  Land  Ltd.  v. Chiltern  and  Others ... where the authorities are 
collected and the limitations of the rule indicated. 
Upon these authorities, in my view, it will be necessary, upon the evidence 
before me, for all persons in the first group to be joined as separate defendants. 
(footnotes omitted) [34] In Barker v Allanson, the plaintiff sought to recover the cost of goods supplied 
to various members of the Chilton Colliery Lodge of the Durham Miners' Association 
at the Lodge's request.16  The plaintiff initially obtained an order from the Registrar 
that four members of the Lodge be appointed to represent the general body of members 
of the Lodge.  A Judge set the order aside, and the English Court of Appeal confirmed 
he had been correct to do so.  The Court of Appeal observed:17 It is plain that all the defendants by representation have not the same interest 
in the cause.  The majority of these defendants would, if they had been named 
as defendants, have been entitled to prove that the goods were not ordered by 
them or with their authority, as they were not members of the Lodge in 1921, 
others might have been able successfully to plead the Statute of Limitations 
by proving that they had no part or lot in the payments that were made from 
time to time, while others might have no answer to the claim.  The present 
case is one to which the law as laid down by Lord Parker of Waddington in 
his speech in the London Association for Protection of Trade v. Greenlands, 
Ld., is certainly applicable, where he said: "In other words, there might be 
separate defences open to some members of the association and not to others, 
and if this were so there would be no common interest within the rule. ... 
(footnote omitted) [35] The Court also said:18 Before deciding in any particular case whether a representative order under 
Order xvi., r. 9, should be made in regard to defendants, it is necessary to 
consider two questions: (1) What is the cause of action? and (2.) What is the 
precise  class  of  potential  defendants  who  are  to  be  represented  by  the 
defendants on the record for the purpose of imposing liability on them if 
judgment is given for the plaintiff?  The vital thing to remember is that 
judgment  against  representative  defendants  means  judgment  against  each 
individual  person  covered  by  the  representation.    It  is  because  of  this 
consequence of a representative judgment that the conditions upon which an 
order to represent may be made are those laid down by Lord Parker in the 
passage from his opinion in London  Association  for  Protection  of  Trade  v. 
Greenlands, Ld. which Greer L.J has quoted.                                                  16  Barker v Allanson [1937] 1 KB 463 (CA). 17  At 473-474. 18  At 475.   (footnote omitted) [36] In Campbell v Thompson, a cleaner employed by an unincorporated club fell 
down some stairs whilst at work.19  She sued the assistant honorary secretary and the 
chairman of the club's house committee, both of whom were members of the club, in 
a representative capacity.    Pilcher J held this to be appropriate, and observed:20 I am well satisfied in the present instance that all the members of the City 
Livery Club have both as employers of the plaintiff and as technical occupiers 
of the club premises the same common interest in resisting the plaintiff's 
claim.  I am told that the club membership is about 2,500.  It is clear that as a 
practical matter it would be impossible to have 2,500 defendants, and it is 
equally clear that the club cannot be sued by name. [37] Practical considerations were to the fore in Talley's Fisheries Ltd v Minister of 
Immigration.21  At issue in that case was the validity of permits issued to the crew of 
foreign fishing vessels.  The plaintiff sought an order appointing a New Zealand 
fishing company to represent the interests of foreign crew members.  McGechan J held 
this to be appropriate because New Zealand fishing companies had a sufficiently 
similar  interest  in  the  validity  of  the  permits  to  justify  an  order  being  made.22  
Furthermore, the plaintiff could not "be expected to join 4,500 assorted individuals 
comprising a shifting pool, many of whom speak no English, and would have even 
less interest in becoming involved in legal proceedings in this country".23 
[38] Similarly, in Whakatane  District  Council  v  Keepa Paterson J made an order 
appointing one of more than 500 landowners to represent all the landowners in a case 
relating to the rateability of the land that they owned.24  All of the landowners had the 
same interest in the outcome of the proceeding, and none could advance a defence that 
did not apply to the others.   
[39] These cases demonstrate that the courts are likely to approve the appointment 
of representative defendants in cases where individual members of the represented 
group are unlikely to have different defences to the plaintiffs' claim.  Where that is not 
                                                 19  Campbell v Thompson [1953] 1 QB 445 (QB).  20  At 451. 21  Talley's Fisheries Ltd v Minister of Immigration (1994) 7 PRNZ 469 (HC). 22  At 471. 23  At 470. 24  Whakatane District Council v Keepa HC Rotorua M7/00, 27 June 2000.   the case, the interests of justice will generally require the plaintiff to proceed against 
the individuals who comprise the group.   
Decision 
Identification of the group to be the subject of the proposed order 
[40] The Crown dealt with the Iwi as a group in settling the treaty claims, and the 
Settlement trustees now hold the treaty assets for the benefit of that group.  The trustees 
also maintain a current register of members of the Iwi who are beneficiaries of the 
settlement.   
[41] I therefore proceed for present purposes on the assumption that it would be 
possible to identify those persons whom it is proposed the Settlement trustees are to 
represent.  They are the persons who are listed on the register held by the Settlement 
trustees and who were more than 18 years of age as at 27 June 2007.  Those persons, 
who counsel advise me number approximately 400, will obviously now be over 
27 years of age.   
The subject matter of the proceeding 
The first and third causes of action 
[42] I deal with these together because they are intertwined.  I consider the subject 
matter of the first cause of action to be the nature and legal effect of any arrangement 
the two joint venture agreements may have created.  The plaintiffs assert that the "Iwi 
Parties" and "Variation Iwi Parties" have breached the two agreements, and seek an 
order  requiring  both  to  perform  their  obligations  under  the  agreements.   In  the 
alternative, the plaintiffs seek an enquiry into damages against those parties.  Any 
damages are likely to include the sums that the 2008 agreement required the Iwi parties 
to repay once they received the treaty settlement assets.   
[43] The amended statement of claim defines "Iwi Parties" and "Variation Iwi 
Parties" as the counterparties to the two joint venture agreements.  The counterparty 
to both agreements with Tahi was the entity described as Te Kawerau ā Maki.  I   therefore take the plaintiffs' claim to extend to individual members of the Iwi even 
though they are not named as parties to the proceeding.25 
[44] The first cause of action appears to contain claims based in both contract and 
equity because, as currently pleaded, it is based on an allegation that the persons who 
signed the two agreements on behalf of Te Kawerau (the Te Kawerau signatories) did 
so in their capacity as either the agents or trustees of members of the Iwi.  This appears 
from the following paragraphs of the amended statement of claim: 19. The 2007 Joint Venture Agreement was executed for the Iwi Members 
by Mr Taua and Piki Taulor. 
20. Mr Taua and Piki Taylor had the authority of the Iwi Members to 
execute the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement. 
21. Mr Taua and Piki Taylor executed the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement 
as agents of the Iwi Members and/or as trustees of the Iwi. 
... 
23. Mr Taua and Piki Taylor had the authority of the Iwi Members to 
manage the Iwi's interests under the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement. 
24. By written agreement dated 22 July 2008 Tahi and the Iwi Members 
agreed to vary the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement (2008 Variation).  
The 2008 Variation is relied upon as if pleaded in full. 
25. By the 2008 Variation the Tribal Authority became, with the Iwi 
Members, a party to the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement. 
26. The 2008 Variation was executed for Tahi by its sole director Dianne 
Lee. 
27. The 2008 Variation was executed for the Iwi Members by Mr Taua 
and Mrs Ewe. 
28. Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe had the authority of the Iwi Members to execute 
the 2008 Variation. 
29. Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe executed the 2008 Variation as agents of the 
Iwi Members and/or as trustees for Te Kawerau ā Maki. 
30. Mr Taua also executed the 2008 Variation as the agent of the Tribal 
Authority. 
31. Mr Taua had the authority of the Tribal Authority to execute the 2008 
Variation.                                                  25  Although the statement of claim does not make this clear, I proceed on the basis that this pleading 
extends only to persons who were over the age of 18 years as at 27 June 2007.  Any other approach 
will lead to difficulties for the plaintiffs in terms of s 6(1) of the Minors' Contracts Act 1969.    32. Mr Taua had the authority of the Tribal Authority Trustees to manage 
the  Tribal  Authority's  interests  under  the  2007  Joint  Venture 
Agreement. 
... 
34. In clause 14 of the 2008 Variation "assets" means all assets held by 
the Iwi Members and related entities for the collective benefit of the 
Iwi Members. 
35. Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe had the authority of the Iwi Members to 
manage the Iwi's interests under the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement 
(as varied). [45] If the Te Kawerau signatories signed the two agreements in their capacity as 
trustees, they would ordinarily be liable in that capacity but members of the Iwi would 
not have any personal liability.  There would be no need for representation orders to 
be made in relation to this aspect of the plaintiffs' claim because it is not advanced 
against the Iwi and relief could not be sought against them. 
[46] If the Te Kawerau signatories are held liable as trustees, they may have a right 
of indemnity against the assets of the trust.  For that reason Mr Heard submitted for 
the plaintiffs that a representation order would be appropriate because the third cause 
of action seeks an order that the plaintiffs be subrogated to any right of indemnity the 
trustees might have against trust property.  I do not accept this submission because I 
consider the issue of subrogation will necessarily be considered in the context of any 
relief that may be granted after the Court has made its primary findings in relation to 
the issue of liability.  If a representation order was required at that point it could still 
be made. 
[47] The statement of claim does not specify the precise basis on which the plaintiffs 
allege  the  Te  Kawarau  signatories  signed  the  joint  venture  agreements  as  the 
authorised agents of the Iwi.  During the hearing, Mr Heard confirmed the plaintiffs 
will  allege  they had  the  actual  authority  of  all  members  of  the  Iwi  to  sign  the 
agreements  on  their  behalf.   Actual  authority  may  be  express  or  implied.26   I 
understood Mr Heard to be saying the plaintiffs will allege Te Kawarau signatories 
                                                 26  Giltrap City Ltd v Commerce Commission [2004] 1 NZLR 608 (CA) at [40]; see also Peter Watts 
and FMB Reynolds Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency (21st ed, Thomson Reuters, London, 2018) 
at [3-003].   had the express authority of the Iwi to enter into the joint venture agreements.  This 
will require the plaintiffs to prove that each member of the Iwi knew of the proposed 
venture and authorised the Te Kawerau signatories to sign the agreements on their 
behalf.   
[48] Each member of the Iwi would therefore be entitled to defend the claim on the 
basis that he or she did not know of the proposed venture and/or did not authorise the 
Te Kawerau signatories to sign the agreements on his or her behalf.  The positions of 
individual members will obviously differ according to the extent to which they were 
aware of what was occurring in 2007 and 2008.  Common sense suggests, however, 
that it is likely some Iwi members had no knowledge of the negotiations with Ms Lee.  
Given that likelihood I do not consider it appropriate to require the Settlement trustees 
to be responsible for ensuring the interests of all members of the Iwi are properly 
protected.   They  cannot  be  expected  to  know or  make  enquiries  as  to whether 
individual members had sufficient knowledge of the proposal to give their informed 
consent to the Te Kawerau signatories signing the agreements on their behalf. 
[49] The ability to advance different defences is an extremely important issue in the 
present case because the plaintiffs are endeavouring to hold individual members of the 
Iwi personally liable for damages that could amount to $1.3 million together with costs 
and interest.  Those persons should have the ability to make their own decisions as to 
how they should conduct their defences.  I acknowledge that the Court has the ability 
to make ancillary orders permitting individual members to "opt in" and defend the 
proceeding themselves.  I have a concern, however, that members of the Iwi may not 
take that option even though they may have a good defence. The only way to alleviate 
this concern is to require the plaintiffs to add individual members of the Iwi as 
respondents and serve the pleadings on them.  This is likely to ensure those persons 
understand the gravity of their position. 
[50] Furthermore, I do not consider the making of a representation order would 
serve the usual purpose of removing the need for a multiplicity of proceedings.  There 
is no need for any other proceeding to be filed.  The plaintiffs can proceed against the 
members of the Iwi by adding them as respondents and arranging for them to be 
served.  The scope of the evidence the plaintiffs will be required to adduce at trial will   also remain the same because they have no option now but to prove that each member 
of the Iwi authorised Te Kawerau signatories to sign the agreements. 
[51] In  addition,  the  plaintiffs  have  suggested  orders  that  would  require  the 
Settlement trustees to serve copies of all documents and Minutes from the proceeding 
on all members of the Iwi currently shown on the register as being more than 18 years 
of age as at 27 June 2007.  This means the same amount of administrative effort will 
be required as would be the case if the Iwi members were named as respondents.  The 
burden  of that  effort would,  however, shift from the  plaintiffs to  the  Settlement 
trustees.  I do not see that as achieving any economy of effort or expense. 
[52] All of these factors persuade me that it would not be appropriate to make the 
representation orders that the plaintiffs seek. 
[53] The position might be different if the plaintiffs relied upon the status of the 
signatories within the Iwi as cloaking them with implied authority to bind individual 
members.  In that event it might be possible to establish an agency relationship 
regardless of the state of knowledge held by individual members of the Iwi.  A claim 
based  on  implied  authority  might  therefore  prevent  individual  members  from 
defending the claim on the basis that they did not know of or consent to the signatories 
entering into the agreements on their behalf. 
[54] As the pleadings currently stand, however, the plaintiffs do not allege agency 
based on implied authority.  In addition, the affidavit Ms Lee filed in support of the 
application does not provide an evidential basis to suggest such a claim may be 
tenable.  The only evidence touching on this point relates to assertions made by 
Mr Taua regarding his ability to bind the Iwi.  These are contained in the following 
paragraphs from Ms Lee's affidavit: 4. Prior to signing the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement Mr Taua assured me 
and my husband on many occasions that he had the authority to execute 
the 2007 Joint Venture Agreement on behalf of the Iwi Members  and 
that  the  Iwi  Members would  be bound  by  the  2007  Joint  Venture 
Agreement.  He also assured us that Mrs Taylor was an important kuia 
or senior member of the Iwi, and that she signed the 2007 Joint Venture 
Agreement in that capacity and did so representing the Iwi Members.  
Mr  Taua  was  (and  still  is)  the  chairman  and  rangatira/chief  of  Te 
Kawerau a Maki and Mrs Taylor was a senior member of the Iwi.  Mr   Taua was also lead negotiator with the Crown for the Treaty Settlement, 
and the lead claimant in the Iwi's claims in the Waitangi Tribunal. 
... 
6. On  22  July  2008  Tahi  and  the  Iwi  Members  agreed  to  vary  the  2007 
Joint  Venture  Agreement  (2008  Variation).    I executed the  2008 
Variation on behalf of Tahi, and Mr Taua and Mrs Hariata Arapo Ewe 
(Mrs Ewe) executed it on behalf of the Iwi Members.  At the time of 
the execution of the 2008 Variation, Mr Taua emphasised again that he 
had the authority to bind the Iwi Members.  He explained that he was 
signing as rangatira/chief of the Iwi.  He also explained that Mrs Ewe 
was a senior member of the Iwi, and co-claimant in the Wai 470 claim 
to the Waitangi Tribunal, and that as such she had the authority to bind 
the Iwi Members. [55] As it presently stands Ms Lee's evidence is arguably insufficient to establish a 
claim based on implied authority.  The focus in such a claim is on the relationship 
between the principal and the agent.  Authority may be implied from a course of 
dealing or from the position of the agent vis-à-vis the principal.27  Generally speaking, 
however, self-authorisation by the agent alone will not be sufficient to establish a claim 
based on implied authority. 
[56] For those reasons, and because I have not heard argument on the point, I would 
not be prepared to make representation orders on the basis of a claim founded on 
implied authority. 
The second cause of action 
[57] Under the second cause of action the plaintiffs allege the defendants were 
unjustly enriched when they received the funds from Tahi.  They seek equitable 
compensation from the defendants as a result. 
[58] The plaintiffs allege that Tahi paid, and the Iwi Parties and Variation Iwi Parties 
received, the monies payable under the two agreements on the basis that Tahi would 
be the Iwi's joint venture partner on the terms set out in the 2007 agreement.  Unlike 
the first cause of action, however, the prayer for relief in this cause of action does not 
seek redress from the Iwi Parties and the Variation Iwi Parties.  Instead it seeks an 
                                                 27 See Peter Watts and FMB Reynolds, above n 26, at [3-003]; Freeman & Lockyer v Buckhurst Park 
Properties Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 (CA) at 502-503.   order requiring the defendants to pay equitable compensation.  This no doubt reflects 
the fact that the plaintiffs acknowledge it is unlikely that individual members of the 
Iwi would have received the funds paid by Tahi. 
[59] It follows that there is therefore no reason to make representation orders in 
relation to this cause of action. 
The fourth cause of action  
[60] Under the fourth cause of action the plaintiffs seek an injunction against the 
Tribal Authority trustees and the Settlement trustees preventing them from developing 
the assets acquired through settlement of the treaty claims with any party other than 
Tahi.  This cause of action does not contain allegations against Iwi members and does 
not seek relief against them.  There is therefore no reason to make representation 
orders in relation to it. 
Conclusion 
[61]    For the reasons set out above I decline to make a representation order in 
relation to the first to fourth causes of action. 
B The claims in relation to the Māngere property  
[62] The fifth and sixth causes of action relate to the Māngere property.  Mr Taua 
has resided in that property throughout the period with which this proceeding is 
concerned. 
[63] The claim under the fifth cause of action arises because Ms Lee contends 
Mr Taua told her the Iwi had agreed to give him a sum equivalent in value to at least 
four per cent of any assets received from the treaty settlement.  This was to recognise 
the commitment and sacrifice Mr Taua and his father had made to the Iwi's cause and, 
in particular, the role they played in pursuing treaty claims on the Iwi's behalf. 
[64] On 28 November 2007, Ms Lee and Mr Taua signed an agreement under which 
Ms Lee agreed to purchase the Māngere property from a company called El Salvador   Ltd.  She agreed to pay the sum of $220,000 for the property in two instalments, the 
first to be paid by 31 December 2007 and the second on a date to be agreed.   
[65] For his part Mr Taua agreed to assign to Ms Lee his right to receive a share of 
the treaty settlement assets.  In return, Ms Lee agreed she would transfer the Māngere 
property to Mr Taua as soon as she received those assets.  
[66] In November 2007 Ms Lee entered into an agreement with El Salvador to 
purchase the Māngere property for $220,000 and she completed the purchase on 
31 January 2008.  By that time Ms Lee had entered into a further agreement with 
Mr Taua under which she leased the Māngere property to Mr Taua for $360 per week.  
In May 2011, the parties renewed the tenancy agreement and Mr Taua agreed to pay 
rent in the sum of $400 per week.   
[67] Ms Lee has never received the share of the treaty settlement assets Mr Taua 
purported to assign to her under the agreement dated 28 November 2007.  Under the 
fifth cause of action Ms Lee seeks an order requiring the Iwi, the Tribal Authority 
trustees and/or the Settlement trustees to perform that agreement or pay damages in 
lieu of specific performance.   
[68] Ms Lee also alleges Mr Taua is now significantly in arrears with the rental 
payable for the Māngere property.  Under the sixth cause of action she seeks judgment 
against Mr Taua in respect of unpaid rental. 
[69] I consider these causes of action involve only Mr Taua and Ms Lee.  Ms Lee 
must enforce any claim she may have to Mr Taua's share of treaty assets against him 
and not the Iwi.  Alternatively, she may amend her claim to allege that the Settlement 
trustees and/or the Tribal Authority trustees hold a proportion of the treaty settlement 
assets on trust for her.  
[70] Similarly, any outstanding rental is owing by Mr Taua and not the Iwi.        
[71]  There is therefore no need for representation orders to be made in relation to 
the fifth and sixth causes of action.              Result 
[72] The application is dismissed.   
Costs 
[73] The second  and  third  respondents  are  the  successful  parties  and  would 
ordinarily be entitled to an award of costs on a category 2B basis together with 
disbursements as fixed by the Registrar.  If counsel cannot reach agreement regarding 
costs they should file succinct memoranda as soon as possible and I will determine 
that issue on the papers.
