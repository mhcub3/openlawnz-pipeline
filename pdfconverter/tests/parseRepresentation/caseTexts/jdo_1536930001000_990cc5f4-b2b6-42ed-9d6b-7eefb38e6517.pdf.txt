 JUDGMENT OF MOORE J
 
 This judgment was delivered by me on 14 September 2018 at 3:00 pm 
pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  
Registrar/ Deputy Registrar 
 
Date: 
     Introduction 
[1] Mr Reekie is a convicted rapist serving a sentence of preventive detention.  He 
was ordered to pay an award of $50,000 in exemplary damages to two of the victims 
of his offending in the Victims' Special Claims Tribunal ("the Tribunal").1  This appeal 
concerns the lawfulness of that award.  Mr Reekie says the process the Tribunal 
followed breached his right to natural justice and that the Tribunal's assessment of 
damages was manifestly unreasonable.   
Background 
[2] Mr Reekie was sentenced on 3 August 2004 on 31 charges, including multiple 
charges of sexual violation against four complainants.  Two of those complainants are 
Claimants A and B, who are the respondents in this appeal.  The offending against 
Claimant A occurred in 1992.  Mr Reekie was sentenced to a term of 14 years' 
imprisonment with a minimum period of nine and a half years.2  Preventive detention 
was not an available sentencing option at that time.  In respect of Claimant B, he was 
sentenced to preventive detention with a non-parole period of 20 years.3 
[3] On 21  July  2012,  Mr  Reekie  made  a  Privacy Act  1993  request  to  the 
Department of Corrections ("Corrections") seeking the provision of certain documents 
about him.  Some of that information was provided on 6 November 2012.  Mr Reekie 
complained  that  the  disclosure  was  insufficient  and  sought  compensation  from 
Corrections for a breach of the Privacy Act.   
[4] On  25  February  2016,  a  settlement  was  reached  between  Mr  Reekie  and 
Corrections.  Corrections acknowledged its management of the request failed to meet 
expected standards.  Corrections agreed to make a payment by way of compensation 
in the sum of $1,350 to be held as follows: "Mr  Reekie  acknowledges  that  in  accordance  with  section  17(1)  of  the 
Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005, the payment of compensation in the 
sum  of  ONE  THOUSAND  AND  THREE  HUNDRED  AND  FIFTY 
DOLLARS ($1,350) will be paid to the Secretary for Justice to be dealt with 
in accordance with the provisions of that Act."                                                  1  Claimant A v Reekie Victims' Special Claims Tribunal VSC001/16, 25 August 2017. 2  R v Reekie HC Auckland T021833, 15 July 2003, at [17]-[18].  3  R v Reekie CA339/03, 3 August 2004.     The Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005 
[5] In order to explain the events that followed, it is necessary to set out the 
framework of the Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005 ("the Act") in some detail.   
[6] The Act represents a legislative response to the awards of compensation made 
in Taunoa  v  Attorney-General to  prisoners  unlawfully  detained  in  a  segregated 
behaviour management regime.4  As the Minister of Justice told Parliament during the 
first reading of the Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Bill:5 "Most people, including myself, have a deep sense that it is wrong that serious 
offenders can be awarded compensation for wrongful treatment without those 
offenders themselves being required to pay compensation to their victims for 
the serious wrongs inflicted upon them." [7] As  well  as  narrowing  the  class  of  cases  in  which  prisoners  can claim 
compensation, the Act establishes a scheme by which victims can make claims against 
payments  of compensation  made  to  prisoners  as  redress  for  the  harm  they  have 
suffered.  "Victim's claim" is defined in s 9 as a claim for damages or exemplary 
damages made by or on behalf of a victim against an offender, based on acts done or 
omitted to be done by the offender in committing the offence. 
[8] The payment of $1,350 to Mr Reekie is an example of a compensation payment 
captured by the Act and claimable by the victims of his offending.  There is also no 
dispute that Claimants A and B are victims under the scheme of the Act.  
[9] Subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Act serves two purposes:6 
(a) it establishes, requires payments into, and regulates the operation of a 
victims' claims trust account ("the account"); and 
(b) it provides a procedure for the making and determination of victims' 
claims.  
                                                 4  Taunoa v Attorney-General (2004) 8 HRNZ 53 (HC).  The damages awarded were ultimately 
reduced in Taunoa v Attorney-General [2007] NZSC 70, [2008] 1 NZLR 429.   5  (14 December 2004) 622 NZPD 17986.  6  Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005, s 3(2).    [10] As is recorded in Mr Reekie's deed of settlement with Corrections, s 17 of the 
Act requires that payments of compensation made to prisoners must be paid to the 
Secretary for Justice to be held in the interest-bearing account, once the steps at 
s 18(1)(a)-(c) have been followed.  The residue may be paid out of the account only in 
accordance with subpart 2, Part 2 of the Act (or any regulations made under s 57).  The 
Secretary of Justice must give notice of payments made into the account.7  The Act 
also sets out how victims' claims may be filed.8  
[11] Once a claim has been filed, it is referred to the Tribunal.  The Tribunal consists 
of a District Court Judge, and its function is to determine victims' claims for damages 
filed under the Act.9  The Tribunal's procedure in determining claims is relatively 
unorthodox.  This is to minimise the impact of the process on victims.  To that end it 
possesses wide powers to regulate the procedure it chooses to follow.10  Claims are 
determined on the papers without the need to hear oral evidence, although this may be 
appropriate  in  certain  situations.11  The  Tribunal  may  receive  as  evidence  any 
statement, document, information or matter that, in the Tribunal's opinion, may assist 
in determining the victim's claim, whether or not such material would be admissible 
in a court of law.  It may also accept as proven, findings of fact that have been accepted 
or proved at the original trial.12  Additionally, it may access relevant Court documents 
or records or request other information.13   
[12] The Tribunal must not accept a victim's claim unless satisfied, on the balance 
of probabilities, that:14 "(a) the claimant is a victim of the offender; and 
(b) the victim has, through or by means of the offence, suffered injury, 
loss, or damage for which the victim has not received, and is not to 
receive, effective redress; and 
(c) the claim discloses a cause of action that is, under the general law, one 
for which damages are, in the particular case, payable."                                                  7  See ss 20-25.  8  Section 28. 9  Section 58. 10  Section 45.  This is subject to the statutory provisions in ss 28-44, 46, 59 and 60 of the Act. 11  Sections 34 and 38. 12  Section 37. 13  Sections 35 and 39.  14  Section 46(2).    [13] If it does accept a claim, the Tribunal may order that an amount of money be 
paid to the victim.15  It may also order payment if a sum is agreed to by all victims and 
the offender, or if it considers a proposed payment is reasonable by way of final 
settlement of all victims' claims concerned.16 
[14] In fixing the amount to be paid, the Tribunal must determine any amounts 
without regard to the amount of money actually held in the account for the offender.17  
Moreover, in determining whether the amount should be paid by way of damages or 
exemplary damages, and in fixing quantum, the Tribunal must apply the general law 
relating to awarding damages.18 
The claims brought by Claimants A and B 
[15] On 30 June 2016, just over a month after the amount of $1,350 was placed into 
the account, notice was given to interested Government departments.  Notice was also 
given in daily newspapers in the five main centres on 2 July 2016, advising that any 
person who had been a victim of Mr Reekie was entitled to make a claim against the 
money held in the account.  Any notice of claim had to be filed before Tuesday, 
3 January 2017.   
[16] Only claims by Claimants A and B were received within the specified time.  
No claims were lodged out of time.  The claims filed sought general or exemplary 
damages, citing the emotional harm the victims had suffered as a result of Mr Reekie's 
sexual offending against them.  
[17] Prior to the hearing Mr Reekie offered $1,000 to each Claimant by way of 
settlement.  He submitted that if his offer was rejected, the claim should be dismissed.   
                                                 15  Section 46(3).  16  Section 46(4).  17  Section 47(1).  18  Section 47(2).    The Tribunal's decision 
[18] Judge C S Blackie, sitting as the Tribunal, found exemplary damages were 
available.  He was satisfied of the matters in s 46(2), namely that: 
(a) each Claimant is a victim of Mr Reekie;  
(b) each, through his offending, has suffered injury, loss or damage for 
which they have not received and are not likely to receive effective 
redress; and 
(c) the  claims disclose  the  torts  of  assault  and  battery  which justify 
exemplary damages.   
[19] He noted the "gross indecencies" suffered by  each of the Claimants, and 
awarded exemplary damages in the sum of $25,000 to each Claimant for Mr Reekie's 
"outrageous conduct".19  
Mr Reekie's appeal  
[20] Mr Reekie has raised six questions of law:20   
(a) Did the Judge err by hearing some matters in Mr Reekie's absence? 
(b) Was Mr Reekie inadequately informed of the basis of the claims against 
him?  
(c) Did  the  Judge  err  in  proceeding  to  hearing  after  being  informed 
Mr Reekie had not been served with either notice of claim? 
(d) Did the Judge err when he allowed the hearing to proceed once made 
aware Mr Reekie was "statute-barred" from making submissions?  
                                                 19  Claimant A v Reekie, above n 1, at [20]. 20  Pursuant to s 51 of the Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005, a party may only appeal a claim 
determined under s 46 on a question of law.   (e) Was there an undue delay in this matter, and if so, who caused it and 
what was its effect? and 
(f) Was the award of exemplary damages available to the Judge and was 
the amount awarded manifestly unreasonable?  
[21] Because  Mr  Reekie  is  self-represented,  an  order  was  made  appointing 
Ms Casey QC as amicus curiae.  She helpfully identified the key issue on appeal: 
whether Mr Reekie was provided with a copy of the claim as required by s 31 of the 
Act.  However, at the hearing the Judge's approach to the assessment of damages also 
assumed significance.  I shall deal with the latter issue separately, although for reasons 
which follow the appeal does not turn on it.   
Was Mr Reekie provided with a copy of the claim? 
[22] Section 31(1) requires that before determining a victim's claim, the Tribunal 
must serve a copy of the claim on the offender and provide a reasonable opportunity 
for the offender to make written submissions.  The claim must be served on the 
offender as soon as practicable after it is filed.21  Section 31(3) then balances the 
privacy interests of victims against the offender's right to natural justice.  It provides 
that information identifying the victim's address must be removed from the copy of 
the claim served on the offender unless, in the Tribunal's opinion, that information is 
necessary to ensure the offender is fully and fairly informed of the nature of the claim.  
Section 31(4) and (5) then relate to the reasonable opportunity given to the offender 
to make submissions: "(4) The Tribunal gives the offender the reasonable opportunity required 
by subsection (1) by requiring his or her written submissions to be 
filed with the Secretary of the Tribunal— 
 (a) within 60 days after the expiry of the periods specified in 
section 33(a); or 
 (b) within  a  further  period  the  Tribunal  is  satisfied,  on  an 
application for the purpose before the expiry of that 60-day 
period, is justified by exceptional circumstances.                                                  21  Section 31(2).    (5) In determining under subsection (4)(b) whether it is satisfied a further 
period is justified by exceptional circumstances, the Tribunal must 
have regard to the number and complexity of the victims' claims filed 
against the offender." [23] With respect to the s 31 requirements, the Judge stated in his decision:22 "The respondent is fully aware of these proceedings, having been served with 
a notice of claim, the summary of the misconduct giving rise to the claim, the 
nature of the relief sought by way of compensatory damages.  Further, I 
directed  by  a  minute,  issued  on  12  April  2017,  that  if  the  claimant's 
representative, Ms Gardner, was able to meet with the respondent, he would 
be able to read the contents of their statements.  He was not, however, to be 
given  copies  of  those  statements,  except  through  instructing  counsel.    I 
imposed that restriction so as to reduce the possibility of the claimants being 
re-victimised.  Despite attempts, no face-to-face meeting has been possible." [24] Mr Reekie disagreed with this summary.  He argued the Judge erroneously 
delegated the responsibility of serving the claims on him to the representative of the 
Claimants, Dr Gardner, who never completed the task.  Relatedly, he argued the 
method of service directed by the Judge did not comply with the strict obligation in 
s 31 to "serve a copy of the claim" or his right to be fully informed of the nature of the 
claims.  He further argued that a complete lack of specificity in the claims means the 
Tribunal's decision is a nullity.  
Analysis – procedural failings 
[25] As Ms Casey helpfully summarised, the documentary record corroborates 
Mr Reekie's account and reveals a serious procedural failure. 
[26] Both claims were filed in December 2016.  But almost six months later, in a 
letter of 4 May 2017, Mr Reekie wrote to the Tribunal advising he still had not been 
served with a copy of the claims.  Earlier, in a Minute of 12 April 2017, the Judge had 
made the following directions as to service:23 "Clearly, with the interests of victims in mind, this Tribunal has the ability 
under its creating Statute to set its own procedure.  Therefore, in this case, I 
make the following directions as to mode of service: 
(1) A notice of claim is to be served on the defendant, such notice to 
contain the following particulars:                                                  22  Claimant A v Reekie, above n 1, at [16]. 23  [Claimant A] v Reekie Victims' Special Claims Tribunal VSC001/16, 12 April 2016, at [4]-[5].    (a) The full name and date of birth of the claimant.  
 (b) A summary of the misconduct giving rise to the claim.  
 (c) The nature of the relief sought by way of compensational 
damages.  
(2) Service of the notice of claim is to be effected personally upon the 
respondent by counsel for the claimant, Ms Gardner. 
At the time of service, assuming she is able to meet personally with the 
respondent, Ms Gardner is to read to the respondent the contents of the 
victims' statements.  He is not, however, to be provided with a copy of their 
statements." [27] For reasons which are not apparent this Minute was not sent to Mr Reekie until 
13 May 2017, just over a month later.  It was accompanied by a covering letter from 
the Registrar, who advised Mr Reekie he would "not be permitted to keep copies of 
the claim[s] and associated documentation".  This advice was wrong; in fact the 
Judge's direction was that Mr Reekie could not be provided copies of the victims' 
statements (they were simply to be read to him).  The letter also advised the meeting 
between Mr Reekie and Dr Gardner would take place on 24 May 2017 at the Special 
Needs Block Interview Room at Auckland Prison.   
[28] On 21 May 2017 Mr Reekie filed a "Notice of Opposition ... to the Minute of 
Judge C S Blackie dated 12 April 2016", complaining the Judge's directions had not 
complied with s 31 and advising he had still not been served with the claims.  He also 
expressed concern that the time for filing submissions, set out in s 31(4), had expired 
and he was time-barred from making submissions.  In a letter sent the same day to 
Dr Gardner he advised that he would not be meeting with her, because he considered 
it would not be proper or lawful service of the claims.   
[29] The Tribunal issued another Minute on 14 June 2017, asking counsel to clarify 
whether Mr Reekie had received the notices of claim.  The Judge also asked counsel 
to advise whether Mr Reekie's settlement offer of $1,000 per Claimant was acceptable.  
This Minute was served on Mr Reekie on 19 June 2017.  He responded the same day 
with a further memorandum informing he had refused to meet with Dr Gardner.  He 
explained  that  when  he  arrived  at  the  Special  Needs  Block  Interview  Room on 
24 May 2017, prison staff advised him the meeting would take place elsewhere.  He 
refused to go with the staff to the new location.  In correspondence dated 26 June 2017   Dr Gardner confirmed this.  She was informed by prison staff that Mr Reekie "insisted 
that we be brought to the cell block to meet with him".  She submitted she had "done 
everything" she could "to ensure Mr Reekie is able to view the submissions as part of 
natural justice, but has refused to meet".   
[30] As a result, Mr Reekie was never provided with a copy of the claim forms 
lodged by the Claimants.  Ms Casey has obtained written confirmation of this from 
the  Tribunal.    Despite  this,  the  Judge  appears  to  have  proceeded  on  the 
misunderstanding Mr Reekie had been served.   
[31] Thus  there  has  been  a  fundamental  procedural  failing.    The mandatory 
requirement that the offender be served a copy of the claim and given a reasonable 
opportunity to make submissions was not met.  While the Tribunal's procedure is 
designed to minimise the impact of the process on the victims, it was envisaged it 
would "still [be] consistent with natural justice requirements."24  In this case, the 
breach of the rules of natural justice has tainted the Tribunal's substantive decision.25   
[32] Before  addressing  what  orders should  be  made,  three  further  comments 
regarding the process followed are necessary.  First, while aspects of the Tribunal's 
procedure are at its discretion, others are not.  These include s 31.26  The requirement 
that Mr Reekie be served with the claims and given a reasonable opportunity to make 
written submissions was not capable of being varied by the Tribunal.  However, as 
Ms Casey pointed out, a person is sufficiently served if any of the methods set out in 
s 27(1) are followed.   
[33] This leads  to  the  second  point.   While  s  31(3)  calls  for  redaction  of 
"information that identifies, or that may lead to the identification of, the address of the 
place where the victim lives", it does not allow for redaction of substantive aspects of 
the claim, particularly those necessary to fully and fairly inform the offender of the 
nature of the claim.  The priority of natural justice over privacy is apparent in the final 
                                                 24  (14 December 2004) 622 NZPD 17986. 25  Ancare New Zealand Ltd v Wyatt (NZ) Ltd [2009] NZCA 211, [2009] 3 NZLR 501 at [46]. 26  Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005, s 45.   part of s 31(3), which allows the Tribunal to not redact the victim's address if that 
information is necessary to ensure the offender is fully and fairly informed.   
[34] Accordingly, in order to be fully and fairly informed and be able to make 
submissions, Mr Reekie must be given more.  I agree with Ms Casey that the Tribunal 
should exercise caution in allowing any information beyond that referred to in s 31(3) 
to be redacted from the claim forms, given the dictates of natural justice.   
[35] Moreover, while I understand the Tribunal's reasons for doing so, I accept 
Mr Reekie's submission that merely having the victims' statements read to him is 
insufficient to enable him to respond to the claims in submissions.  Any orders made 
to protect the victims should not impinge on the offender's reasonable opportunity to 
make written submissions on the claims.  As Ms Casey submitted, Mr Reekie's ability 
to sensibly respond should be read in light of s 27(1) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights 
Act 1990.  It is a matter for the Tribunal to determine how this objective is best given 
effect to, but it seems to me it would be necessary for Mr Reekie to have some means 
for taking contemporaneous notes when the victims' statements are presented to him; 
that he has available some form of aide-mémoire when later preparing submissions.  
Alternatively, as Ms Casey suggested, he could be given limited access to the victims' 
statements while preparing his submissions, with the statements retrieved once his 
preparation is complete.   
[36] As Ms Casey sensibly pointed out, to avoid the tension between the victims' 
interests  and  natural  justice  arising  in  future  cases,  the  Tribunal  could  consider 
exercising  its  powers  to  obtain  copies  of  relevant  sentencing  notes  and Court 
transcripts rather than obtaining statements from the victims themselves.  Such a 
course would have the benefit of focusing on the offender's conduct, which is the 
primary consideration in assessing any award of exemplary damages in any event.  It 
may be that on any rehearing, this is the course the Tribunal will elect to adopt.   
[37] Finally,  despite  Mr  Reekie's claim,  he  was  not  time-barred  from  making 
submissions.  The Judge, in his Minute of 12 April 2017, directed that "notice of 
defence to the applications and any evidence pertaining thereto should be filed within   28 days of the date of service".27  Given the time for filing in accordance with 
s 31(4)(a) expired 60 days after the deadline for the filing of claims, on 5 March 2017, 
this constituted a "further period" for filing "justified by exceptional circumstances" 
in terms of s 31(4)(b).  I agree that not being informed of service of the claim until 
some  two  months  after  this  deadline  constituted  "exceptional  circumstances".  
However, given the strict time limits in s 31, and the requirement to give the offender 
a reasonable opportunity to make written submissions, the situation was not ideal.  
Service needed to be effected earlier consistent with the principles of natural justice.   
What order should be made? 
[38] Mr Reekie submitted I should strike the claims out altogether, but in the event 
I did not I should substitute the Tribunal's decision with my own, implementing a 
settlement offer made by Mr Reekie of $5,000 per Claimant.  While Claimant B is 
prepared to accept this offer, Claimant A is not.  In the absence of agreement, and not 
having  heard submissions  on  damages,  I  am  not  prepared  to  substitute  my  own 
decision.   
[39] In any event it is clear to me the Tribunal's decision cannot stand.  I agree with 
Ms Casey that the appropriate course is to refer the matter back to the Tribunal for 
rehearing.  That course will have the additional benefit of the Tribunal receiving and 
considering submissions on both damages and quantum.  It will also provide the 
Tribunal with the benefit of the guiding observations which follow.   
The assessment of damages  
[40] During the hearing, I discussed with counsel whether, in the event I was to 
remit the matter back to the Tribunal for rehearing, some guidance on the approach to 
assessing exemplary damages might be desirable.  I did so because I was concerned 
the Judge's assessment may have been inadequate.  I called for further submissions on 
the approach to assessing and fixing exemplary damages, as well as the effect of 
s 47(1) of the Act on any award of damages.  I have now had the benefit of considering 
those very helpful submissions in preparing this judgment, and place on record my 
                                                 27  [Claimant A] v Reekie, above n 23, at [8].    gratitude to the parties for their assistance.  What follows are observations intended to 
assist the Tribunal in its approach to determining exemplary damages.   
[41] While  the  Tribunal's  procedure  is  designed  to  minimise  the  risk  of 
retraumatising victims, ss 46 and 47 are clear; the Tribunal is bound by the general 
law  in  determining  liability  and  quantum.    It  will  not  be  sufficient  to  make  a 
determination of liability, particularly in a claim for exemplary damages (for which 
under the general law there exists a high threshold) without a robust analysis of the 
law and the facts.  I disagree with the Judge's conclusion that:28 "There are authorities limiting the amount of exemplary damages available if 
the perpetrator has otherwise been punished by the criminal law.  However, it 
would defeat the purpose of this Act if such an approach were taken in respect 
of claims such as those currently presented." [42] On the contrary, the Act plainly contemplates that the Tribunal will engage in 
such issues, adopting the applicable legal principles.  Moreover, in my view the 
Tribunal's duty to rigorously analyse the merits of a claim for damages, including what 
quantum should be awarded, is particularly relevant in the context of s 47(1).  As 
noted, that provision requires the Tribunal to determine any  amounts payable to 
victims without taking into account the funds actually held in the offender's account.  
It exposes offenders who suffer wrongful treatment in prison to a summary procedure 
by which victims may claim substantial damages against them greater than the amount 
of money paid to an offender as compensation.  To the extent an award of damages 
exceeds the amount held as compensation for the offender, the victims may enforce 
the order as if it was a judgment of the District Court.29  The consequences of an 
excessive  award  will  include adjudicating  the  offender bankrupt.    The  stern 
consequences  of  an  award  made  under the  Act  therefore  compel  a  robust 
determination.   
[43] I agree with Ms Casey the Tribunal must address each of the three elements in 
s 46(2) (set out above at [12]) in its decision.  Moreover, each element must have some 
evidential foundation, although s 59 provides that such a foundation need not derive 
from any information or matters which would be admissible in a court of law.   
                                                 28  Claimant A v Reekie, above n 1, at [18].  29  Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005, s 48(4)-(6).     [44] Section 46(2)(a) requires the Tribunal to be satisfied the claimant is a victim of 
the offender.  As well as meeting the s 8 definition, they must not have obtained, or be 
seeking, judgment in respect of the conduct on which the claim is based in civil 
proceedings against the offender.30  I agree with Ms Casey that the claim forms 
completed by the Claimants do not fully cover the requirements of s 28(1)(c), nor the 
comparable requirement at s 46(2)(b) that they have not received and are not likely to 
receive effective redress for the injury, loss or damage they have suffered.  In terms of 
the remainder of s 46(2)(b), I accept that the victims' statements and the sentencing 
notes were sufficient evidence of injury, loss or damage. 
[45] As  for  ss  46(2)(c)  and  47(2),  the Tribunal's  conclusion  that  Mr  Reekie's 
offending  discloses  the  tort  of  battery  is  plainly  correct.    However, further 
considerations flow from the requirement that the general law of liability and quantum 
of damages be applied.  The availability of a limitation defence is one factor that needs 
to be considered under the general law.  While s 64 provides for the purposes of the 
Act standard limitation periods are suspended for the period the offender is serving a 
sentence of imprisonment, that does not affect limitation defences which have accrued 
prior to the commencement of imprisonment.  It pertains only to the running of 
limitation periods during the term of imprisonment; it does not affect their existence.31  
Therefore in respect of Claimant A (who was the victim of offending in 1992), subject 
to important questions of the reasonable discoverability of the cause of action,32 and 
whether  Claimant  A  was  operating  under  a  disability  for  any  period  after  the 
offending,33 it appears the six-year period for bringing a claim in tort under s 4(1) of 
the Limitation Act 1950 expired before Mr Reekie was convicted and imprisoned.  
These are legal questions which need to be resolved before an award of exemplary 
damages may be made.   
[46] A second factor is that, as the Judge noted, claims for compensatory damages 
arising out of personal injury covered by the Accident Compensation Act 2001 or its 
                                                 30  Section 28(1)(c).  31  Relatedly, s 63(2)(b) states s 64 applies whether or not the action was one in respect of which a 
limitation defence could, before the commencement on 4 June 2005 of the Act, have been pleaded.   32  Jay v Jay [2014] NZCA 445, [2015] NZAR 861 at [77], citing Murray v Morel & Co Ltd [2007] 
NZSC 27, [2007] 3 NZLR 721 at [49]. 33  Limitation Act 1950, s 24.  See generally Jay v Jay, above n 32, at [90], applying T v H [1995] 3 
NZLR 37 (CA) at 61.    predecessors are barred under the general law.34  Damages for mental injuries caused 
by intentional assaults or batteries were within the statutory bar of the Accident 
Compensation  Act  1982,35 and s  8(3)  of  the  Accident  Rehabilitation  and 
Compensation Insurance Act 1992.  Moreover, the current Accident Compensation Act 
provides cover for mental injury caused by criminal acts such as Mr Reekie's.36  The 
claims therefore had to be for exemplary damages, which fall outside the statutory 
bar.37  
[47] Exemplary  damages  are  to  be  confined  to  torts  which  are  committed 
intentionally or with subjective recklessness, which is the close moral equivalent of 
intention.38  The purpose of an award of exemplary damages was discussed extensively 
by the Supreme Court in Couch v Attorney-General (No 2), where McGrath J stated:39  "Two linked considerations ... are, in my opinion, of fundamental importance 
in deciding when exemplary damages are to be awarded.  The first is that the 
primary purpose of exemplary damages is to punish a defendant for wrongful 
conduct.  Deterrence of the offender is likely to be the effect of an award, as 
is vindication of the plaintiff who suffers harm and receives the damages.  But 
these are both incidental consequences and should not divert the courts from 
the punitive purpose of the remedy. 
Secondly, because the focus of the courts is on punishment, it is the culpability 
of the defendant's conduct that justifies an award of exemplary damages.  
Assessment of the degree of culpability is straightforward where a defendant 
intentionally causes harm." [48] Outrageousness of conduct is not the sole criterion: the focal point of the 
inquiry is not the committing of the tort per se, but the subjective appreciation of the 
risk of wrongful harm.40  Because exemplary damages are punitive, the focus must be 
on the conduct of the tortfeasor rather than the extent of harm.  In determining whether 
the threshold for exemplary damages is met, the Tribunal may thus take into account 
the  mental  elements  of  the  offending.   The  sentencing  Judge's  comments  about 
culpability will also likely be relevant.  The Tribunal should also consider the gloss on 
                                                 34  Accident Compensation Act 2001, s 317.  Section 6 defines "former Act".   35  Willis v Attorney General [1989] 3 NZLR 574 (CA) at 576; M v Roper [2018] NZHC 2330 at 
[164], [171]. 36  Accident Compensation Act 2001, s 21. 37  Section 319.  38  Couch v Attorney-General (No 2) [2010] NZSC 27, [2010] 3 NZLR 149 at [178] per Tipping J.  39  At [238]-[239]. 40  At [178]-[179].  See also Wright v Bhosale [2016] NZCA 593, [2017] NZAR 203 at [52]-[53].   liability for exemplary damages provided by s 319(3) of the Accident Compensation 
Act: "(3) In determining whether to award exemplary damages and, if they are 
to be awarded, the amount of them, the court may have regard to— 
 (a) whether a penalty has been imposed on the defendant for an 
offence involving the  conduct concerned  in the  claim for 
exemplary damages; and 
 (b) if so, the nature of the penalty." [49] If satisfied exemplary damages are available, the Tribunal must then turn to fix 
quantum.  In doing so, the following principles outlined by Hammond J in McDermott 
v Wallace should guide the assessment:41 
(a) the claimant must be the victim of punishable behaviour; 
(b) there should be moderation in making awards; 
(c) the means of the parties should be considered; 
(d) other awards to the claimant are relevant; 
(e) regard must be had to the imposition of any criminal penalty; and 
(f) the conduct of the parties is relevant, including that of the claimant. 
[50] Another  cornerstone  consideration,  as  Tipping  J  stated  in Couch,  is  that 
exemplary damages "are not a surrogate way of awarding greater compensation".42   
[51] Additionally,  aggravating  and  mitigating  factors  are  relevant.43  While  in 
comparison  to  other  torts  sexual  battery  cases  tend  to  attract  larger  awards  of 
exemplary damages due to the nature of the acts involved, "much depends on the 
individual circumstances of each case", including the lack of means of the parties.44 
                                                 41  McDermott v Wallace [2005] 3 NZLR 661 (CA) at [94]-[102], as summarised in Hikurangi Forest 
Farms Ltd v Negara Developments [2018] NZHC 607, [2018] NZAR 804 at [204].  42  Couch v Attorney-General (No 2), above n 38, at [95].  43  Jay v Jay, above n 32, at [105]. 44  At [106].    [52] I make no comment on the final award arrived at by the Tribunal.  However, it 
is not apparent consideration was given to the multiple and competing factors relevant 
to assessing quantum.  These principles should have been weighed alongside the 
Judge's  finding  of  outrageous  conduct;  namely  Mr  Reekie's  lack  of  means,  his 
criminal penalty, the effect of two awards, and the principle of moderation.  His 
conduct, including his settlement offers and/or the presence of remorse, if any, was 
also relevant.   
[53] It is hoped that these observations will assist the Tribunal in its determination 
of  liability  and  quantum  at  the  rehearing.    I  also  gratefully  adopt  Ms  Casey's 
suggestion that reference may be had to the tables summarising awards of exemplary 
damages, and the relevant factors underpinning each award in the cases therein, in 
J v J45 and McDermott v Wallace,46 though such reference should not supervene the 
requirement for a robust assessment of the relevant principles. 
Result 
[54] The appeal is allowed.  
[55] A rehearing in the Tribunal is ordered.
